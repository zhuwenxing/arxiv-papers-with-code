    "abstract": "We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a\nprevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to\nintegrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing\nevaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to\nmultimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information\nagainst sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG\nevaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information\ncoverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that\nMiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality\njudgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three\nprominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the\nlimitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic\nevaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess\nmultimodal RAG.",

Existing\napproaches fall into two paradigms: single-vector retrieval, which is efficient\nbut coarse, and multi-vector retrieval, which is accurate but computationally\nexpensive. To address this trade-off, we propose HEAVEN, a two-stage\nhybrid-vector framework. In the first stage, HEAVEN efficiently retrieves\ncandidate pages using a single-vector method over Visually-Summarized Pages\n(VS-Pages), which assemble representative visual layouts from multiple pages.\nIn the second stage, it reranks candidates with a multi-vector method while\nfiltering query tokens by linguistic importance to reduce redundant\ncomputations. To evaluate retrieval systems under realistic conditions, we also\nintroduce ViMDOC, the first benchmark for visually rich, multi-document, and\nlong-document retrieval. Across four benchmarks, HEAVEN attains 99.87% of the\nRecall@1 performance of multi-vector models on average while reducing per-query\ncomputation by 99.82%, achieving efficiency and accuracy.

    "abstract": "Fact-checking numerical claims is critical as the presence of numbers provide\nmirage of veracity despite being fake potentially causing catastrophic impacts\non society. The prior works in automatic fact verification do not primarily\nfocus on natural numerical claims. A typical human fact-checker first retrieves\nrelevant evidence addressing the different numerical aspects of the claim and\nthen reasons about them to predict the veracity of the claim. Hence, the search\nprocess of a human fact-checker is a crucial skill that forms the foundation of\nthe verification process. Emulating a real-world setting is essential to aid in\nthe development of automated methods that encompass such skills. However,\nexisting benchmarks employ heuristic claim decomposition approaches augmented\nwith weakly supervised web search to collect evidences for verifying claims.\nThis sometimes results in less relevant evidences and noisy sources with\ntemporal leakage rendering a less realistic retrieval setting for claim\nverification. Hence, we introduce QuanTemp++: a dataset consisting of natural\nnumerical claims, an open domain corpus, with the corresponding relevant\nevidence for each claim. The evidences are collected through a claim\ndecomposition process approximately emulating the approach of human\nfact-checker and veracity labels ensuring there is no temporal leakage. Given\nthis dataset, we also characterize the retrieval performance of key claim\ndecomposition paradigms.

Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,\nwhich limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce\nDeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous\nthinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent\nreasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,\nparticularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the\naccumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding\nmechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,\nand tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical\ninformation. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we\ndevelop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that\nleverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to\nassign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments\non eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,\nTMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,\nHLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both\nlabeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios.

Despite these\nbenefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They\ntypically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal\nitem similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the\nautoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive\nsimilar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a\nuniversal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item\nmay be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To\naddress this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that\nincorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs.\nThis design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs\nunder different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple\ninterpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions.

First,\nintra-item consistency: the n digits jointly specify one item, yet the\nleft-to-right causality trains each digit only under its prefix and blocks\nbidirectional cross-digit evidence, collapsing supervision to a single causal\npath. Second, inter-digit heterogeneity: digits differ in semantic granularity\nand predictability, while the uniform next-token objective assigns equal weight\nto all digits, overtraining easy digits and undertraining hard digits. To\naddress these two issues, we propose DiffGRM, a diffusion-based GR model that\nreplaces the autoregressive decoder with a masked discrete diffusion model\n(MDM), thereby enabling bidirectional context and any-order parallel generation\nof SID digits for recommendation. Specifically, we tailor DiffGRM in three\naspects: (1) tokenization with Parallel Semantic Encoding (PSE) to decouple\ndigits and balance per-digit information; (2) training with On-policy Coherent\nNoising (OCN) that prioritizes uncertain digits via coherent masking to\nconcentrate supervision on high-value signals; and (3) inference with\nConfidence-guided Parallel Denoising (CPD) that fills higher-confidence digits\nfirst and generates diverse Top-K candidates.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,\nincluding text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on\npublicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work\nshowed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise\ndata warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL\nbenchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily\navailable. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural\nlanguage questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database\nadministrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to\nconstruct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only\nchallenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce\nBenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of\ndomain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural\nlanguage descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to\nensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated\nenterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically\nreduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our\nresults show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions\nenhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation\nrobustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress\noffers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL\nmodels on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via\nour public GitHub repository at\nhttps://github.com/fabian-wenz/enterprise-txt2sql and is also accessible on our\nwebsite at http://dsg-mcgraw.csail.mit.edu:5000.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the design and architecture of REI, a novel system\nfor indexing log data for regular expression queries. Our main contribution is\nan $n$-gram-based indexing strategy and an efficient storage mechanism that\nresults in a speedup of up to 14x compared to state-of-the-art regex processing\nengines that do not use indexing, using only 2.1% of extra space. We perform a\ndetailed study that analyzes the space usage of the index and the improvement\nin workload execution time, uncovering interesting insights. Specifically, we\nshow that even an optimized implementation of strategies such as inverted\nindexing, which are widely used in text processing libraries, may lead to\nsuboptimal performance for regex indexing on log analysis tasks. Overall, the\nREI approach presented in this paper provides a significant boost when\nevaluating regular expression queries on log data. REI is also modular and can\nwork with existing regular expression packages, making it easy to deploy in a\nvariety of settings.

    "abstract": "Discovering valuable insights from rich data is a crucial task for\nexploratory data analysis. Sequential pattern mining (SPM) has found widespread\napplications across various domains. In recent years, low-utility sequential\npattern mining (LUSPM) has shown strong potential in applications such as\nintrusion detection and genomic sequence analysis. However, existing research\nin utility-based SPM focuses on high-utility sequential patterns, and the\ndefinitions and strategies used in high-utility SPM cannot be directly applied\nto LUSPM. Moreover, no algorithms have yet been developed specifically for\nmining low-utility sequential patterns. To address these problems, we formalize\nthe LUSPM problem, redefine sequence utility, and introduce a compact data\nstructure called the sequence-utility chain to efficiently record utility\ninformation. Furthermore, we propose three novel algorithm--LUSPM_b, LUSPM_s,\nand LUSPM_e--to discover the complete set of low-utility sequential patterns.\nLUSPM_b serves as an exhaustive baseline, while LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e build upon\nit, generating subsequences through shrinkage and extension operations,\nrespectively. In addition, we introduce the maximal non-mutually contained\nsequence set and incorporate multiple pruning strategies, which significantly\nreduce redundant operations in both LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e. Finally, extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that both LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e substantially\noutperform LUSPM_b and exhibit excellent scalability. Notably, LUSPM_e achieves\nsuperior efficiency, requiring less runtime and memory consumption than\nLUSPM_s. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zhidong-Lin/LUSPM.",

    "abstract": "Industrial question-answering (QA) systems require higher safety and\nreliability than general-purpose dialogue models, as errors in high-risk\nscenarios such as equipment fault diagnosis can have severe consequences.\nAlthough multi-agent large language models enhance reasoning depth, they suffer\nfrom uncontrolled iterations and unverifiable outputs, and conventional\ndistillation methods struggle to transfer collaborative reasoning capabilities\nto lightweight, deployable student models. To address these challenges, we\npropose Knowledge Graph-guided Multi-Agent System Distillation (KG-MASD). Our\napproach formulates distillation as a Markov Decision Process and incorporates\na knowledge graph as a verifiable structured prior to enrich state\nrepresentation and ensure convergence. By integrating collaborative reasoning\nwith knowledge grounding, KG-MASD generates high-confidence instruction-tuning\ndata and jointly distills reasoning depth and verifiability into compact\nstudent models suitable for edge deployment. Experiments on an industrial QA\ndataset show that KG-MASD improves accuracy by 2.4 per cent to 20.1 per cent\nover baselines and significantly enhances reliability, enabling trustworthy AI\ndeployment in safety-critical industrial scenarios.
