SPARTA: Scalable and Principled Benchmark of Tree-Structured Multi-hop QA over Text and Tables,"Sungho Park, Jueun Kim, Wook-Shin Han",2026-02-26,2602.23286v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23286v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23286v1,information_retrieval,cs.CL,"Real-world Table-Text question answering (QA) tasks require models that can reason across long text and source tables, traversing multiple hops and executing complex operations such as aggregation.

These documents are widely observed across domains and account for a large portion of real-world data.

(2) Existing approaches lack effective representations to capture hierarchical structures within documents (e.g., associating tables with nested chapter titles) and to preserve layout-specific distinctions (e.g., differentiating sidebars from main content).

Vectorizing the Trie: Efficient Constrained Decoding for LLM-based Generative Retrieval on Accelerators,"Zhengyang Su, Isay Katsman, Yueqi Wang, Ruining He, Lukasz Heldt, Raghunandan Keshavan, Shao-Chuan Wang, Xinyang Yi, Mingyan Gao, Onkar Dalal, Lichan Hong, Ed Chi, Ningren Han",2026-02-26,2602.22647v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22647v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22647v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Generative retrieval has emerged as a powerful paradigm for LLM-based recommendation. However, industrial recommender systems often benefit from restricting the output space to a constrained subset of items based on business logic (e.g. enforcing content freshness or product category), which standard autoregressive decoding cannot natively support. Moreover, existing constrained decoding methods that make use of prefix trees (Tries) incur severe latency penalties on hardware accelerators (TPUs/GPUs). In this work, we introduce STATIC (Sparse Transition Matrix-Accelerated Trie Index for Constrained Decoding), an efficient and scalable constrained decoding technique designed specifically for high-throughput LLM-based generative retrieval on TPUs/GPUs. By flattening the prefix tree into a static Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix, we transform irregular tree traversals into fully vectorized sparse matrix operations, unlocking massive efficiency gains on hardware accelerators. We deploy STATIC on a large-scale industrial video recommendation platform serving billions of users. STATIC produces significant product metric impact with minimal latency overhead (0.033 ms per step and 0.25% of inference time), achieving a 948x speedup over a CPU trie implementation and a 47-1033x speedup over a hardware-accelerated binary-search baseline. Furthermore, the runtime overhead of STATIC remains extremely low across a wide range of practical configurations. To the best of our knowledge, STATIC enables the first production-scale deployment of strictly constrained generative retrieval. In addition, evaluation on academic benchmarks demonstrates that STATIC can considerably improve cold-start performance for generative retrieval.

Where Relevance Emerges: A Layer-Wise Study of Internal Attention for Zero-Shot Re-Ranking,"Haodong Chen, Shengyao Zhuang, Zheng Yao, Guido Zuccon, Teerapong Leelanupab",2026-02-26,2602.22591v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22591v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22591v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Zero-shot document re-ranking with Large Language Models (LLMs) has evolved from Pointwise methods to Listwise and Setwise approaches that optimize computational efficiency. Despite their success, these methods predominantly rely on generative scoring or output logits, which face bottlenecks in inference latency and result consistency. In-Context Re-ranking (ICR) has recently been proposed as an $O(1)$ alternative method. ICR extracts internal attention signals directly, avoiding the overhead of text generation. However, existing ICR methods simply aggregate signals across all layers; layer-wise contributions and their consistency across architectures have been left unexplored. Furthermore, no unified study has compared internal attention with traditional generative and likelihood-based mechanisms across diverse ranking frameworks under consistent conditions.
  In this paper, we conduct an orthogonal evaluation of generation, likelihood, and internal attention mechanisms across multiple ranking frameworks. We further identify a universal ""bell-curve"" distribution of relevance signals across transformer layers, which motivates the proposed Selective-ICR strategy that reduces inference latency by 30%-50% without compromising effectiveness. Finally, evaluation on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark shows that precisely capturing high-quality in-context attention signals fundamentally reduces the need for model scaling and reinforcement learning: a zero-shot 8B model matches the performance of 14B reinforcement-learned re-rankers, while even a 0.6B model outperforms state-of-the-art generation-based approaches.

RETLLM: Training and Data-Free MLLMs for Multimodal Information Retrieval,"Dawei Su, Dongsheng Wang",2026-02-25,2602.22278v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22278v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.22278v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Multimodal information retrieval (MMIR) has gained attention for its flexibility in handling text, images, or mixed queries and candidates. Recent breakthroughs in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) boost MMIR performance by incorporating MLLM knowledge under the contrastive finetuning framework. However, they suffer from pre-training inconsistency and require large datasets. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, RetLLM, designed to query MLLMs for MMIR in a training- and data-free manner. Specifically, we formulate MMIR as a similarity score generation task and prompt MLLMs to directly predict retrieval scores in a coarse-then-fine pipeline. At the coarse stage, a top-k filtering strategy builds a small yet high-quality candidate pool for each query, enabling MLLMs to focus on semantically relevant candidates. Subsequently, the retrieval score is predicted by feeding both the query and candidate into MLLMs at the fine stage. Importantly, we propose a visual enhancement module during reasoning to help MLLMs re-pick forgotten visuals, improving retrieval. Extensive experiments on MMIR benchmarks show that RetLLM outperforms fine-tuned models. Ablation studies further verify each component. Our work demonstrates that MLLMs can achieve strong MMIR performance without any training, highlighting their inherent multimodal reasoning ability in a simple, scalable framework.

Late interaction has emerged as a dominant paradigm for information retrieval in text, images, visual documents, and videos, but its computation and storage costs grow linearly with document length, making it costly for image-, video-, and audio-rich corpora. To address this limitation, we explore query-agnostic methods for compressing multi-vector document representations under a constant vector budget. We introduce four approaches for index compression: sequence resizing, memory tokens, hierarchical pooling, and a novel attention-guided clustering (AGC). AGC uses an attention-guided mechanism to identify the most semantically salient regions of a document as cluster centroids and to weight token aggregation. Evaluating these methods on retrieval tasks spanning text (BEIR), visual-document (ViDoRe), and video (MSR-VTT, MultiVENT 2.0), we show that attention-guided clustering consistently outperforms other parameterized compression methods (sequence resizing and memory tokens), provides greater flexibility in index size than non-parametric hierarchical clustering, and achieves competitive or improved performance compared to a full, uncompressed index.

However, effectively translating these semantic signals into traditional collaborative embeddings remains an open challenge. Existing approaches typically fall into two extremes: direct inference methods are computationally prohibitive for large-scale retrieval, while embedding-based methods primarily focus on unilateral feature augmentation rather than holistic collaborative signal enhancement. To bridge this gap, we propose Topology-Augmented Graph Collaborative Filtering (TAGCF), a novel framework that transforms semantic knowledge into topological connectivity. Unlike existing approaches that depend on textual features or direct interaction synthesis, TAGCF employs LLMs to infer interaction intents and underlying causal relationships from user-item pairs, representing these insights as intermediate attribute nodes within an enriched User-Attribute-Item (U-A-I) graph. Furthermore, to effectively model the heterogeneous relations in this augmented structure, we propose Adaptive Relation-weighted Graph Convolution (ARGC), which employs relation-specific prediction networks to dynamically estimate the importance of each relation type. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets and CF backbones demonstrate consistent improvements, with comprehensive evaluations including cold-start scenarios validating the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

Answering this question has been difficult because pre-training data is often a ""black box"" -- unknown or inaccessible. The recent release of nanochat -- a family of small LLMs with fully open pre-training data -- addresses this as it provides a transparent view into where a model's parametric knowledge comes from. Towards the goal of understanding how knowledge is encoded by LLMs, we release NanoKnow, a benchmark dataset that partitions questions from Natural Questions and SQuAD into splits based on whether their answers are present in nanochat's pre-training corpus. Using these splits, we can now properly disentangle the sources of knowledge that LLMs rely on when producing an output. To demonstrate NanoKnow's utility, we conduct experiments using eight nanochat checkpoints. Our findings show: (1) closed-book accuracy is strongly influenced by answer frequency in the pre-training data, (2) providing external evidence can mitigate this frequency dependence, (3) even with external evidence, models are more accurate when answers were seen during pre-training, demonstrating that parametric and external knowledge are complementary, and (4) non-relevant information is harmful, with accuracy decreasing based on both the position and the number of non-relevant contexts.

ManCAR: Manifold-Constrained Latent Reasoning with Adaptive Test-Time Computation for Sequential Recommendation,"Kun Yang, Yuxuan Zhu, Yazhe Chen, Siyao Zheng, Bangyang Hong, Kangle Wu, Yabo Ni, Anxiang Zeng, Cong Fu, Hui Li",2026-02-23,2602.20093v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20093v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.20093v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Sequential recommendation increasingly employs latent multi-step reasoning to enhance test-time computation. Despite empirical gains, existing approaches largely drive intermediate reasoning states via target-dominant objectives without imposing explicit feasibility constraints. This results in latent drift, where reasoning trajectories deviate into implausible regions. We argue that effective recommendation reasoning should instead be viewed as navigation on a collaborative manifold rather than free-form latent refinement. To this end, we propose ManCAR (Manifold-Constrained Adaptive Reasoning), a principled framework that grounds reasoning within the topology of a global interaction graph. ManCAR constructs a local intent prior from the collaborative neighborhood of a user's recent actions, represented as a distribution over the item simplex. During training, the model progressively aligns its latent predictive distribution with this prior, forcing the reasoning trajectory to remain within the valid manifold. At test time, reasoning proceeds adaptively until the predictive distribution stabilizes, avoiding over-refinement. We provide a variational interpretation of ManCAR to theoretically validate its drift-prevention and adaptive test-time stopping mechanisms. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ManCAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 46.88% relative improvement w.r.t. NDCG@10.

Complex multi-omics signals can be adaptively refined using a mixture-of-experts architecture, emphasizing the most informative omics components. Building upon this representation, CURE implicitly retrieves patient-specific latent subgroups that capture both baseline survival dynamics and treatment-dependent variations. Experimental results on METABRIC and TCGA-LUAD datasets demonstrate that proposed CURE model consistently outperforms strong baselines in survival analysis, evaluated using the Time-dependent Concordance Index ($C^{td}$) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS).

In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study investigating the reliability and structure of user-centric CRS evaluation on static dialogue transcripts. We collected 1,053 annotations from 124 crowd workers on 200 ReDial dialogues using the 18-dimensional CRS-Que framework.

Our results show that utilitarian and outcome-oriented dimensions such as accuracy, usefulness, and satisfaction achieve moderate reliability under aggregation, whereas socially grounded constructs such as humanness and rapport are substantially less reliable. Furthermore, many dimensions collapse into a single global quality signal, revealing a strong halo effect in third-party judgments.

Classical ARM methods rely on frequent itemset mining, leading to rule explosion and poor scalability, while recent neural approaches mitigate these issues but suffer from degraded performance in low-data regimes. Tabular foundation models (TFMs), pretrained on diverse tabular data with strong in-context generalization, provide a basis for addressing these limitations. We introduce a model-agnostic association rule learning framework that extracts association rules from any conditional probabilistic model over tabular data, enabling us to leverage TFMs. We then introduce TabProbe, an instantiation of our framework that utilizes TFMs as conditional probability estimators to learn association rules out-of-the-box without frequent itemset mining. We evaluate our approach on tabular datasets of varying sizes based on standard ARM rule quality metrics and downstream classification performance. The results show that TFMs consistently produce concise, high-quality association rules with strong predictive performance and remain robust in low-data settings without task-specific training.

PIPE-RDF: An LLM-Assisted Pipeline for Enterprise RDF Benchmarking,Suraj Ranganath,2026-02-15,2602.18497v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18497v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.18497v1,databases,cs.DB,"Enterprises rely on RDF knowledge graphs and SPARQL to expose operational data through natural language interfaces, yet public KGQA benchmarks do not reflect proprietary schemas, prefixes, or query distributions. We present PIPE-RDF, a three-phase pipeline that constructs schema-specific NL-SPARQL benchmarks using reverse querying, category-balanced template generation, retrieval-augmented prompting, deduplication, and execution-based validation with repair. We instantiate PIPE-RDF on a fixed-schema company-location slice (5,000 companies) derived from public RDF data and generate a balanced benchmark of 450 question-SPARQL pairs across nine categories. The pipeline achieves 100% parse and execution validity after repair, with pre-repair validity rates of 96.5%-100% across phases. We report entity diversity metrics, template coverage analysis, and cost breakdowns to support deployment planning. We release structured artifacts (CSV/JSONL, logs, figures) and operational metrics to support model evaluation and system planning in real-world settings.

DTBench: A Synthetic Benchmark for Document-to-Table Extraction,"Yuxiang Guo, Zhuoran Du, Nan Tang, Kezheng Tang, Congcong Ge, Yunjun Gao",2026-02-14,2602.13812v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13812v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.13812v2,databases,cs.DB,"Document-to-table (Doc2Table) extraction derives structured tables from unstructured documents under a target schema, enabling reliable and verifiable SQL-based data analytics. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in flexible information extraction, their ability to produce precisely structured tables remains insufficiently understood, particularly for indirect extraction that requires complex capabilities such as reasoning and conflict resolution. Existing benchmarks neither explicitly distinguish nor comprehensively cover the diverse capabilities required in Doc2Table extraction. We argue that a capability-aware benchmark is essential for systematic evaluation. However, constructing such benchmarks using human-annotated document-table pairs is costly, difficult to scale, and limited in capability coverage. To address this, we adopt a reverse Table2Doc paradigm and design a multi-agent synthesis workflow to generate documents from ground-truth tables. Based on this approach, we present DTBench, a synthetic benchmark that adopts a proposed two-level taxonomy of Doc2Table capabilities, covering 5 major categories and 13 subcategories. We evaluate several mainstream LLMs on DTBench, and demonstrate substantial performance gaps across models, as well as persistent challenges in reasoning, faithfulness, and conflict resolution. DTBench provides a comprehensive testbed for data generation and evaluation, facilitating future research on Doc2Table extraction.

No Need to Train Your RDB Foundation Model,"Linjie Xu, Yanlin Zhang, Quan Gan, Minjie Wang, David Wipf",2026-02-14,2602.13697v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13697v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.13697v1,databases,cs.AI,"Relational databases (RDBs) contain vast amounts of heterogeneous tabular information that can be exploited for predictive modeling purposes. But since the space of potential targets is vast across enterprise settings, how can we \textit{avoid retraining} a new model each time we wish to predict a new quantity of interest? Foundation models based on in-context learning (ICL) offer a convenient option, but so far are largely restricted to single-table operability. In generalizing to multiple interrelated tables, it is essential to compress variably-sized RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples for consumption by the decoder. However, the details here are critical: unlike existing supervised learning RDB pipelines, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that ICL-specific compression should be constrained \emph{within} high-dimensional RDB columns where all entities share units and roles, not \textit{across} columns where the relevance of heterogeneous data types cannot possibly be determined without label information. Conditioned on this restriction, we then demonstrate that encoder expressiveness is actually not compromised by excluding trainable parameters. Hence we arrive at a principled family of RDB encoders that can be seamlessly paired with already-existing single-table ICL foundation models, whereby no training or fine-tuning is required. From a practical standpoint, we develop scalable SQL primitives to implement the encoder stage, resulting in an easy-to-use open-source RDB foundation model\footnote{\label{foot: RDBLearn_learn} https://github.com/HKUSHXLab/rdblearn} capable of robust performance on unseen datasets out of the box.",https://github.com/HKUSHXLab/rdblearn,
RDBLearn: Simple In-Context Prediction Over Relational Databases,"Yanlin Zhang, Linjie Xu, Quan Gan, David Wipf, Minjie Wang",2026-02-14,2602.18495v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18495v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.18495v1,databases,cs.DB,"Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL) show that a single pretrained model can adapt to new prediction tasks from a small set of labeled examples, avoiding per-task training and heavy tuning. However, many real-world tasks live in relational databases, where predictive signal is spread across multiple linked tables rather than a single flat table. We show that tabular ICL can be extended to relational prediction with a simple recipe: automatically featurize each target row using relational aggregations over its linked records, materialize the resulting augmented table, and run an off-the-shelf tabular foundation model on it. We package this approach in \textit{RDBLearn} (https://github.com/HKUSHXLab/rdblearn), an easy-to-use toolkit with a scikit-learn-style estimator interface that makes it straightforward to swap different tabular ICL backends; a complementary agent-specific interface is provided as well. Across a broad collection of RelBench and 4DBInfer datasets, RDBLearn is the best-performing foundation model approach we evaluate, at times even outperforming strong supervised baselines trained or fine-tuned on each dataset.",https://github.com/HKUSHXLab/rdblearn,
Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search in Vector Databases: System Design and Performance Analysis,"Abylay Amanbayev, Brian Tsan, Tri Dang, Florin Rusu",2026-02-11,2602.11443v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11443v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11443v1,databases,cs.DB,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications increasingly rely on Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS) to combine semantic retrieval with metadata constraints. While algorithmic innovations for FANNS have been proposed, there remains a lack of understanding regarding how generic filtering strategies perform within Vector Databases. In this work, we systematize the taxonomy of filtering strategies and evaluate their integration into FAISS, Milvus, and pgvector. To provide a robust benchmarking framework, we introduce a new relational dataset, \textit{MoReVec}, consisting of two tables, featuring 768-dimensional text embeddings and a rich schema of metadata attributes. We further propose the \textit{Global-Local Selectivity (GLS)} correlation metric to quantify the relationship between filters and query vectors.
  Our experiments reveal that algorithmic adaptations within the engine often override raw index performance. Specifically, we find that: (1) \textit{Milvus} achieves superior recall stability through hybrid approximate/exact execution; (2) \textit{pgvector}'s cost-based query optimizer frequently selects suboptimal execution plans, favoring approximate index scans even when exact sequential scans would yield perfect recall at comparable latency; and (3) partition-based indexes (IVFFlat) outperform graph-based indexes (HNSW) for low-selectivity queries. To facilitate this analysis, we extend the widely-used \textit{ANN-Benchmarks} to support filtered vector search and make it available online. Finally, we synthesize our findings into a set of practical guidelines for selecting index types and configuring query optimizers for hybrid search workloads.",https://github.com/aabylay/ANN-benchmark-HQ,The artifacts are available at: https://github.com/aabylay/ANN-benchmark-HQ
