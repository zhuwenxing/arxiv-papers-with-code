Seeing Through the MiRAGE: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Alexander Martin, William Walden, Reno Kriz, Dengjia Zhang, Kate Sanders, Eugene Yang, Chihsheng Jin, Benjamin Van Durme",2025-10-28,2510.24870v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24870v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24870v1,information_retrieval,cs.CL,"We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.",https://github.com/alexmartin1722/mirage,https://github.com/alexmartin1722/mirage

discovery, scientific search, and enterprise knowledge management. Existing
approaches fall into two paradigms: single-vector retrieval, which is efficient
but coarse, and multi-vector retrieval, which is accurate but computationally
expensive. To address this trade-off, we propose HEAVEN, a two-stage
hybrid-vector framework. In the first stage, HEAVEN efficiently retrieves
candidate pages using a single-vector method over Visually-Summarized Pages

In the second stage, it reranks candidates with a multi-vector method while
filtering query tokens by linguistic importance to reduce redundant
computations. To evaluate retrieval systems under realistic conditions, we also
introduce ViMDOC, the first benchmark for visually rich, multi-document, and
long-document retrieval. Across four benchmarks, HEAVEN attains 99.87% of the

mirage of veracity despite being fake potentially causing catastrophic impacts
on society. The prior works in automatic fact verification do not primarily
focus on natural numerical claims. A typical human fact-checker first retrieves
relevant evidence addressing the different numerical aspects of the claim and
then reasons about them to predict the veracity of the claim. Hence, the search
process of a human fact-checker is a crucial skill that forms the foundation of
the verification process. Emulating a real-world setting is essential to aid in
the development of automated methods that encompass such skills. However,
existing benchmarks employ heuristic claim decomposition approaches augmented
with weakly supervised web search to collect evidences for verifying claims.
This sometimes results in less relevant evidences and noisy sources with
temporal leakage rendering a less realistic retrieval setting for claim
verification. Hence, we introduce QuanTemp++: a dataset consisting of natural
numerical claims, an open domain corpus, with the corresponding relevant
evidence for each claim. The evidences are collected through a claim
decomposition process approximately emulating the approach of human
fact-checker and veracity labels ensuring there is no temporal leakage. Given
this dataset, we also characterize the retrieval performance of key claim
decomposition paradigms. Finally, we observe their effect on the outcome of the
verification pipeline and draw insights. The code for data pipeline along with

DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,

discrete tokens (called semantic IDs) and autoregressively generate the next
tokens as predictions, showing advantages such as memory efficiency,
scalability, and the potential to unify retrieval and ranking. Despite these
benefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They
typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal
item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the
autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive
similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a
universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item
may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To
address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that
incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs.
This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs
under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple
interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions. Experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 over

enabling users to express preferences and receive recommendations through

challenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate
required output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the
end of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage
framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender
systems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a
Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded
demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In
Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats
each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too
fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal
credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the
geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates.
Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges
faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines. Code and

item via a tokenizer as an n-digit semantic ID (SID) and predicts the next item
by autoregressively generating its SID conditioned on the user's history.
However, two structural properties of SIDs make ARMs ill-suited. First,
intra-item consistency: the n digits jointly specify one item, yet the
left-to-right causality trains each digit only under its prefix and blocks
bidirectional cross-digit evidence, collapsing supervision to a single causal
path. Second, inter-digit heterogeneity: digits differ in semantic granularity
and predictability, while the uniform next-token objective assigns equal weight
to all digits, overtraining easy digits and undertraining hard digits. To
address these two issues, we propose DiffGRM, a diffusion-based GR model that
replaces the autoregressive decoder with a masked discrete diffusion model
(MDM), thereby enabling bidirectional context and any-order parallel generation
of SID digits for recommendation. Specifically, we tailor DiffGRM in three
aspects: (1) tokenization with Parallel Semantic Encoding (PSE) to decouple
digits and balance per-digit information; (2) training with On-policy Coherent
Noising (OCN) that prioritizes uncertain digits via coherent masking to
concentrate supervision on high-value signals; and (3) inference with
Confidence-guided Parallel Denoising (CPD) that fills higher-confidence digits
first and generates diverse Top-K candidates. Experiments show consistent gains
over strong generative and discriminative recommendation baselines on multiple
