MetaAgent: Toward Self-Evolving Agent via Tool Meta-Learning,"Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu",2025-08-01,2508.00271v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00271v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00271v1,information_retrieval,cs.AI,"In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the
principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on
practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal
workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking
abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural
language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by
a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts
self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into
concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts.
Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent
knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its
ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual,
data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent
incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing
model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging
knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp,
MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or
exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving
agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery. We provide our

Melody-Lyrics Matching with Contrastive Alignment Loss,"Changhong Wang, Michel Olvera, GaÃ«l Richard",2025-07-31,2508.00123v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00123v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00123v1,information_retrieval,eess.AS,"The connection between music and lyrics is far beyond semantic bonds.
Conceptual pairs in the two modalities such as rhythm and rhyme, note duration
and syllabic stress, and structure correspondence, raise a compelling yet
seldom-explored direction in the field of music information retrieval. In this
paper, we present melody-lyrics matching (MLM), a new task which retrieves
potential lyrics for a given symbolic melody from text sources. Rather than
generating lyrics from scratch, MLM essentially exploits the relationships
between melody and lyrics. We propose a self-supervised representation learning
framework with contrastive alignment loss for melody and lyrics. This has the
potential to leverage the abundance of existing songs with paired melody and
lyrics. No alignment annotations are required. Additionally, we introduce
sylphone, a novel representation for lyrics at syllable-level activated by
phoneme identity and vowel stress. We demonstrate that our method can match
melody with coherent and singable lyrics with empirical results and intuitive
examples. We open source code and provide matching examples on the companion

Personalized Education with Ranking Alignment Recommendation,"Haipeng Liu, Yuxuan Liu, Ting Long",2025-07-31,2507.23664v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23664v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23664v1,information_retrieval,cs.AI,"Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students

we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR

"Not Just What, But When: Integrating Irregular Intervals to LLM for Sequential Recommendation","Wei-Wei Du, Takuma Udagawa, Kei Tateno",2025-07-31,2507.23209v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23209v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23209v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Time intervals between purchasing items are a crucial factor in sequential
recommendation tasks, whereas existing approaches focus on item sequences and
often overlook by assuming the intervals between items are static. However,
dynamic intervals serve as a dimension that describes user profiling on not
only the history within a user but also different users with the same item
history. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that
integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel
interval-infused attention to jointly consider information of items and
intervals. Furthermore, unlike prior studies that address the cold-start
scenario only from the perspectives of users and items, we introduce a new
viewpoint: the interval perspective to serve as an additional metric for
evaluating recommendation methods on the warm and cold scenarios. Extensive
experiments on 3 benchmarks with both traditional- and LLM-based baselines
demonstrate that our IntervalLLM achieves not only 4.4% improvements in average
but also the best-performing warm and cold scenarios across all users, items,
and the proposed interval perspectives. In addition, we observe that the cold
scenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant
performance drop among all recommendation methods. This finding underscores the
necessity of further research on interval-based cold challenges and our
integration of interval information in the realm of sequential recommendation

Generative Recommendation with Semantic IDs: A Practitioner's Handbook,"Clark Mingxuan Ju, Liam Collins, Leonardo Neves, Bhuvesh Kumar, Louis Yufeng Wang, Tong Zhao, Neil Shah",2025-07-29,2507.22224v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22224v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22224v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Generative recommendation (GR) has gained increasing attention for its
promising performance compared to traditional models. A key factor contributing
to the success of GR is the semantic ID (SID), which converts continuous
semantic representations (e.g., from large language models) into discrete ID
sequences. This enables GR models with SIDs to both incorporate semantic
information and learn collaborative filtering signals, while retaining the
benefits of discrete decoding. However, varied modeling techniques,
hyper-parameters, and experimental setups in existing literature make direct
comparisons between GR proposals challenging. Furthermore, the absence of an
open-source, unified framework hinders systematic benchmarking and extension,
slowing model iteration. To address this challenge, our work introduces and
open-sources a framework for Generative Recommendation with semantic ID, namely
GRID, specifically designed for modularity to facilitate easy component
swapping and accelerate idea iteration. Using GRID, we systematically
experiment with and ablate different components of GR models with SIDs on
public benchmarks. Our comprehensive experiments with GRID reveal that many
overlooked architectural components in GR models with SIDs substantially impact
performance. This offers both novel insights and validates the utility of an

Injecting External Knowledge into the Reasoning Process Enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Minghao Tang, Shiyu Ni, Jiafeng Guo, Keping Bi",2025-07-25,2507.19333v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19333v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19333v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large
language models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e.,
low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is
critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have
equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing
them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by
this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that
explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming
to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We
validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the
retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA
datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG
performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,
where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,
where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently
improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can
also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that
incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for
building more robust RAG systems. The code can be found

Leave No One Behind: Fairness-Aware Cross-Domain Recommender Systems for Non-Overlapping Users,"Weixin Chen, Yuhan Zhao, Li Chen, Weike Pan",2025-07-23,2507.17749v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17749v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17749v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) methods predominantly leverage overlapping
users to transfer knowledge from a source domain to a target domain. However,
through empirical studies, we uncover a critical bias inherent in these
approaches: while overlapping users experience significant enhancements in
recommendation quality, non-overlapping users benefit minimally and even face
performance degradation. This unfairness may erode user trust, and,
consequently, negatively impact business engagement and revenue. To address
this issue, we propose a novel solution that generates virtual source-domain
users for non-overlapping target-domain users. Our method utilizes a dual
attention mechanism to discern similarities between overlapping and
non-overlapping users, thereby synthesizing realistic virtual user embeddings.
We further introduce a limiter component that ensures the generated virtual
users align with real-data distributions while preserving each user's unique
characteristics. Notably, our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly
integrated into any CDR model. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three
