Leveraging Language Semantics for Collaborative Filtering with TextGCN and TextGCN-MLP: Zero-Shot vs In-Domain Performance,"Andrei Chernov, Haroon Wahab, Oleg Novitskij",2025-10-14,2510.12461v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12461v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12461v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"In recent years, various approaches have been proposed to leverage large
language models (LLMs) for incorporating textual information about items into
recommender systems. Existing methods primarily focus on either fine-tuning
LLMs to generate recommendations or integrating LLM-based embeddings into
downstream models. In this work, we follow the latter direction and propose
\textbf{TextGCN}, which applies parameter-free graph convolution layers
directly over LLM-based item-title embeddings, instead of learning ID-based
embeddings as in traditional methods. By combining language semantics with
graph message passing, this architecture achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, significantly outperforming prior approaches. Furthermore, we
introduce \textbf{TextGCN-MLP}, which extends TextGCN with a trainable
multilayer perceptron trained using a contrastive loss, achieving
state-of-the-art in-domain performance on recommendation benchmarks. However,
the zero-shot performance of TextGCN-MLP remains lower than that of TextGCN,
highlighting the trade-off between in-domain specialization and zero-shot
generalization. We release our code on github at

What Generative Search Engines Like and How to Optimize Web Content Cooperatively,"Yujiang Wu, Shanshan Zhong, Yubin Kim, Chenyan Xiong",2025-10-13,2510.11438v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11438v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11438v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"By employing large language models (LLMs) to retrieve documents and generate
natural language responses, Generative Engines, such as Google AI overview and
ChatGPT, provide significantly enhanced user experiences and have rapidly
become the new form of search. Their rapid adoption also drives the needs of
Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), as content providers are eager to gain
more traction from them. In this paper, we introduce AutoGEO, a framework to
automatically learn generative engine preferences when using retrieved contents
for response generation, and rewrite web contents for more such traction.
AutoGEO first prompts frontier LLMs to explain generative engine preferences
and extract meaningful preference rules from these explanations. Then it uses
preference rules as context engineering for AutoGEO$_\text{API}$, a
prompt-based GEO system, and as rule-based rewards to train
AutoGEO$_\text{Mini}$, a cost-effective GEO model. Experiments on the standard
GEO-Bench and two newly constructed benchmarks using real user queries
demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoGEO in enhancing content traction while
preserving search utility. Analyses confirm the learned rules' robustness and
abilities to capture unique preferences in variant domains, and AutoGEO
systems' ability to embed them in content optimization. The code is released at

Question Answering (QA) in the financial sector, where accurate and
contextually grounded insights from complex public disclosures are crucial.
However, existing financial RAG systems face two significant challenges: (1)
they struggle to process heterogeneous data formats, such as text, tables, and
figures; and (2) they encounter difficulties in balancing general-domain
applicability with company-specific adaptation. To overcome these challenges,
we present VeritasFi, an innovative hybrid RAG framework that incorporates a
multi-modal preprocessing pipeline alongside a cutting-edge two-stage training
strategy for its re-ranking component. VeritasFi enhances financial QA through
three key innovations: (1) A multi-modal preprocessing pipeline that seamlessly
transforms heterogeneous data into a coherent, machine-readable format. (2) A
tripartite hybrid retrieval engine that operates in parallel, combining deep
multi-path retrieval over a semantically indexed document corpus, real-time
data acquisition through tool utilization, and an expert-curated memory bank
for high-frequency questions, ensuring comprehensive scope, accuracy, and
efficiency. (3) A two-stage training strategy for the document re-ranker, which
initially constructs a general, domain-specific model using anonymized data,
followed by rapid fine-tuning on company-specific data for targeted
applications. By integrating our proposed designs, VeritasFi presents a
groundbreaking framework that greatly enhances the adaptability and robustness

Multi-Granularity Sequence Denoising with Weakly Supervised Signal for Sequential Recommendation,"Liang Li, Zhou Yang, Xiaofei Zhu",2025-10-12,2510.10564v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10564v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10564v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item based on user
interests in historical interaction sequences. Historical interaction sequences
often contain irrelevant noisy items, which significantly hinders the
performance of recommendation systems. Existing research employs unsupervised
methods that indirectly identify item-granularity irrelevant noise by
predicting the ground truth item. Since these methods lack explicit noise
labels, they are prone to misidentify users' interested items as noise.
Additionally, while these methods focus on removing item-granularity noise
driven by the ground truth item, they overlook interest-granularity noise,
limiting their ability to perform broader denoising based on user interests. To
address these issues, we propose Multi-Granularity Sequence Denoising with
Weakly Supervised Signal for Sequential Recommendation(MGSD-WSS). MGSD-WSS
first introduces the Multiple Gaussian Kernel Perceptron module to map the
original and enhance sequence into a common representation space and utilizes
weakly supervised signals to accurately identify noisy items in the historical
interaction sequence. Subsequently, it employs the item-granularity denoising
module with noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain denoised item
representations. Then, it extracts target interest representations from the
ground truth item and applies noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain
denoised interest representations. Finally, based on the denoised item and
interest representations, MGSD-WSS predicts the next item. Extensive
experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art sequence recommendation and denoising models. Our

Hierarchical Semantic RL: Tackling the Problem of Dynamic Action Space for RL-based Recommendations,"Minmao Wang, Xingchen Liu, Shijie Yi, Likang Wu, Hongke Zhao, Fei Pan, Qingpeng Cai, Peng Jiang",2025-10-10,2510.09167v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09167v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09167v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Recommender Systems (RS) are fundamental to modern online services. While
most existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has
begun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value.
However, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic
action spaces inherent in recommendation, which hinder stable policy learning.
To resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which
reframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL
encodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to
their original items via a fixed, invertible lookup during execution. To align
decision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN)
operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state
modeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual,
thereby stabilizing training and reducing representation-decision mismatch. In
parallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates,
enabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a
large-scale production dataset from a leading Chinese short-video advertising
platform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online
deployment over a seven-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% CVR lift with
only a 1.251% increase in cost, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for

from e-commerce to streaming services. A fundamental challenge in this domain
is learning effective embeddings from sparse user-item interactions. While
contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to this
issue, generating augmented views for contrastive learning through most
existing random data augmentation methods often leads to the alteration of
original semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
GDA4Rec (Generative Data Augmentation in graph contrastive learning for
Recommendation) to generate high-quality augmented views and provide robust
self-supervised signals. Specifically, we employ a noise generation module that
leverages deep generative models to approximate the distribution of original
data for data augmentation. Additionally, GDA4Rec further extracts an item
complement matrix to characterize the latent correlations between items and
provide additional self-supervised signals. Lastly, a joint objective that
integrates recommendation, data augmentation and contrastive learning is used
to enforce the model to learn more effective and informative embeddings.
Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to demonstrate the
superiority of the model. The code is available at:

Personalize Before Retrieve: LLM-based Personalized Query Expansion for User-Centric Retrieval,"Yingyi Zhang, Pengyue Jia, Derong Xu, Yi Wen, Xianneng Li, Yichao Wang, Wenlin Zhang, Xiaopeng Li, Weinan Gan, Huifeng Guo, Yong Liu, Xiangyu Zhao",2025-10-10,2510.08935v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08935v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08935v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) critically depends on effective query
expansion to retrieve relevant information. However, existing expansion methods
adopt uniform strategies that overlook user-specific semantics, ignoring
individual expression styles, preferences, and historical context. In practice,
identical queries in text can express vastly different intentions across users.
This representational rigidity limits the ability of current RAG systems to
generalize effectively in personalized settings. Specifically, we identify two
core challenges for personalization: 1) user expression styles are inherently
diverse, making it difficult for standard expansions to preserve personalized
intent. 2) user corpora induce heterogeneous semantic structures-varying in
topical focus and lexical organization-which hinders the effective anchoring of
expanded queries within the user's corpora space. To address these challenges,
we propose Personalize Before Retrieve (PBR), a framework that incorporates
user-specific signals into query expansion prior to retrieval. PBR consists of
two components: P-PRF, which generates stylistically aligned pseudo feedback
using user history for simulating user expression style, and P-Anchor, which
performs graph-based structure alignment over user corpora to capture its
structure. Together, they produce personalized query representations tailored
for retrieval. Experiments on two personalized benchmarks show that PBR
consistently outperforms strong baselines, with up to 10% gains on PersonaBench
across retrievers. Our findings demonstrate the value of modeling
personalization before retrieval to close the semantic gap in user-adaptive RAG
systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zhang-Yingyi/PBR-code.",https://github.com/Zhang-Yingyi/PBR-code,

""needle-in-a-haystack"" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy

haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated

rankings while remaining hard to detect. Stage 1 uses Greedy Coordinate
Gradient to shortlist candidate tokens at the current position by combining the
gradient of the rank-target with a readability score; Stage 2 evaluates those

sampling. RAF generates ranking-promoting prompts token-by-token, guided by
dual objectives: maximizing ranking effectiveness and preserving linguistic

boosts the rank of target items using naturalistic language, with greater
robustness than existing methods in both promoting target items and maintaining

in utility-based SPM focuses on high-utility sequential patterns, and the
definitions and strategies used in high-utility SPM cannot be directly applied
to LUSPM. Moreover, no algorithms have yet been developed specifically for
mining low-utility sequential patterns. To address these problems, we formalize

score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%

AutoPK: Leveraging LLMs and a Hybrid Similarity Metric for Advanced Retrieval of Pharmacokinetic Data from Complex Tables and Documents,"Hossein Sholehrasa, Amirhossein Ghanaatian, Doina Caragea, Lisa A. Tell, Jim E. Riviere, Majid Jaberi-Douraki",2025-09-26,2510.00039v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00039v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00039v1,databases,cs.DB,"Pharmacokinetics (PK) plays a critical role in drug development and
regulatory decision-making for human and veterinary medicine, directly
affecting public health through drug safety and efficacy assessments. However,
PK data are often embedded in complex, heterogeneous tables with variable
structures and inconsistent terminologies, posing significant challenges for
automated PK data retrieval and standardization. AutoPK, a novel two-stage
framework for accurate and scalable extraction of PK data from complex
scientific tables. In the first stage, AutoPK identifies and extracts PK
parameter variants using large language models (LLMs), a hybrid similarity
metric, and LLM-based validation. The second stage filters relevant rows,
converts the table into a key-value text format, and uses an LLM to reconstruct
a standardized table. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of 605 PK tables,
including captions and footnotes, AutoPK shows significant improvements in
precision and recall over direct LLM baselines. For instance, AutoPK with LLaMA
3.1-70B achieved an F1-score of 0.92 on half-life and 0.91 on clearance
parameters, outperforming direct use of LLaMA 3.1-70B by margins of 0.10 and
0.21, respectively. Smaller models such as Gemma 3-27B and Phi 3-12B with
AutoPK achieved 2-7 fold F1 gains over their direct use, with Gemma's
hallucination rates reduced from 60-95% down to 8-14%. Notably, AutoPK enabled
open-source models like Gemma 3-27B to outperform commercial systems such as
GPT-4o Mini on several PK parameters. AutoPK enables scalable and
high-confidence PK data extraction, making it well-suited for critical
applications in veterinary pharmacology, drug safety monitoring, and public
health decision-making, while addressing heterogeneous table structures and
terminology and demonstrating generalizability across key PK parameters. Code

Play by the Type Rules: Inferring Constraints for LLM Functions in Declarative Programs,"Parker Glenn, Alfy Samuel, Daben Liu",2025-09-24,2509.20208v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20208v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20208v1,databases,cs.CL,"Integrating LLM powered operators in declarative query languages allows for
the combination of cheap and interpretable functions with powerful,
generalizable language model reasoning. However, in order to benefit from the
optimized execution of a database query language like SQL, generated outputs
must align with the rules enforced by both type checkers and database contents.
Current approaches address this challenge with orchestrations consisting of
many LLM-based post-processing calls to ensure alignment between generated
outputs and database values, introducing performance bottlenecks. We perform a
study on the ability of various sized open-source language models to both parse
and execute functions within a query language based on SQL, showing that small
language models can excel as function executors over hybrid data sources. Then,
we propose an efficient solution to enforce the well-typedness of LLM
functions, demonstrating 7% accuracy improvement on a multi-hop question
answering dataset with 53% improvement in latency over comparable solutions. We
