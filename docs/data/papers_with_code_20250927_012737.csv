Rejuvenating Cross-Entropy Loss in Knowledge Distillation for Recommender Systems,"Zhangchi Zhu, Wei Zhang",2025-09-25,2509.20989v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20989v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20989v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD)
for recommender systems. KD for recommender systems targets at distilling
rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be
computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the
connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when
performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound
of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the
item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our
goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically
demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the
gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated
Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items
given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked
by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy
is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption
of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

FORGE: Forming Semantic Identifiers for Generative Retrieval in Industrial Datasets,"Kairui Fu, Tao Zhang, Shuwen Xiao, Ziyang Wang, Xinming Zhang, Chenchi Zhang, Yuliang Yan, Junjun Zheng, Yu Li, Zhihong Chen, Jian Wu, Xiangheng Kong, Shengyu Zhang, Kun Kuang, Yuning Jiang, Bo Zheng",2025-09-25,2509.20904v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20904v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20904v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Semantic identifiers (SIDs) have gained increasing attention in generative
retrieval (GR) due to their meaningful semantic discriminability. However,
current research on SIDs faces three main challenges: (1) the absence of
large-scale public datasets with multimodal features, (2) limited investigation
into optimization strategies for SID generation, which typically rely on costly
GR training for evaluation, and (3) slow online convergence in industrial
deployment. To address these challenges, we propose FORGE, a comprehensive
benchmark for FOrming semantic identifieR in Generative rEtrieval with
industrial datasets. Specifically, FORGE is equipped with a dataset comprising
14 billion user interactions and multimodal features of 250 million items
sampled from Taobao, one of the biggest e-commerce platforms in China.
Leveraging this dataset, FORGE explores several optimizations to enhance the
SID construction and validates their effectiveness via offline experiments
across different settings and tasks. Further online analysis conducted on our
platform, which serves over 300 million users daily, reveals a 0.35% increase
in transaction count, highlighting the practical impact of our method.
Regarding the expensive SID validation accompanied by the full training of GRs,
we propose two novel metrics of SID that correlate positively with
recommendation performance, enabling convenient evaluations without any GR
training. For real-world applications, FORGE introduces an offline pretraining
schema that reduces online convergence by half. The code and data are available

Are Smaller Open-Weight LLMs Closing the Gap to Proprietary Models for Biomedical Question Answering?,"Damian Stachura, Joanna Konieczna, Artur Nowak",2025-09-23,2509.18843v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18843v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18843v1,information_retrieval,cs.CL,"Open-weight versions of large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing,

Single-Branch Network Architectures to Close the Modality Gap in Multimodal Recommendation,"Christian Ganhör, Marta Moscati, Anna Hausberger, Shah Nawaz, Markus Schedl",2025-09-23,2509.18807v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18807v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18807v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Traditional recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering, using past
user-item interactions to help users discover new items in a vast collection.
In cold start, i.e., when interaction histories of users or items are not

Hybrid recommender systems (HRSs) often employ multimodal learning to combine
collaborative and side information, which we jointly refer to as modalities.
Though HRSs can provide recommendations when some modalities are missing, their
quality degrades. In this work, we utilize single-branch neural networks
equipped with weight sharing, modality sampling, and contrastive loss to
provide accurate recommendations even in missing modality scenarios by
narrowing the modality gap. We compare these networks with multi-branch

information retrieval tasks like passage ranking. Our research examines how
instruction-following capabilities in LLMs interact with multi-document
comparison tasks, identifying what we term the ""Ranking Blind Spot"", a
characteristic of LLM decision processes during comparative evaluation. We
analyze how this ranking blind spot affects LLM evaluation systems through two
approaches: Decision Objective Hijacking, which alters the evaluation goal in
pairwise ranking systems, and Decision Criteria Hijacking, which modifies
relevance standards across ranking schemes. These approaches demonstrate how
content providers could potentially influence LLM-based ranking systems to
affect document positioning. These attacks aim to force the LLM ranker to
prefer a specific passage and rank it at the top. Malicious content providers
can exploit this weakness, which helps them gain additional exposure by
attacking the ranker. In our experiment, We empirically show that the proposed
attacks are effective in various LLMs and can be generalized to multiple
ranking schemes. We apply these attack to realistic examples to show their
effectiveness. We also found stronger LLMs are more vulnerable to these
attacks. Our code is available at:

the audio signal, the lyrics, or the music video clips. This has motivated the
development of multimodal datasets and methods for Music Information Retrieval
(MIR) tasks such as genre classification or autotagging. Music can be described
at different levels of granularity, for instance defining genres at the level
of artists or music albums. However, most datasets for multimodal MIR neglect
this aspect and provide data at the level of individual music tracks. We aim to
fill this gap by providing Music4All Artist and Album (Music4All A+A), a
dataset for multimodal MIR tasks based on music artists and albums. Music4All
A+A is built on top of the Music4All-Onion dataset, an existing track-level

representations, and textual descriptors for 6,741 artists and 19,511 albums.
Furthermore, since Music4All A+A is built on top of Music4All-Onion, it allows
access to other multimodal data at the track level, including user--item
interaction data. This renders Music4All A+A suitable for a broad range of MIR
tasks, including multimodal music recommendation, at several levels of
granularity. To showcase the use of Music4All A+A, we carry out experiments on
multimodal genre classification of artists and albums, including an analysis in

Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly

supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable

enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query

commit more transactions at 1-WRTT latency, and incurs much less throughput
overhead. Evaluation results show that Tiga outperforms all baselines,
achieving 1.3--7.2$\times$ higher throughput and 1.4--4.6$\times$ lower
latency. Tiga is open-sourced at

Schema Inference for Tabular Data Repositories Using Large Language Models,"Zhenyu Wu, Jiaoyan Chen, Norman W. Paton",2025-09-04,2509.04632v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04632v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04632v1,databases,cs.DB,"Minimally curated tabular data often contain representational inconsistencies
across heterogeneous sources, and are accompanied by sparse metadata. Working
with such data is intimidating. While prior work has advanced dataset discovery
and exploration, schema inference remains difficult when metadata are limited.
We present SI-LLM (Schema Inference using Large Language Models), which infers
a concise conceptual schema for tabular data using only column headers and cell
values. The inferred schema comprises hierarchical entity types, attributes,
and inter-type relationships. In extensive evaluation on two datasets from web
tables and open data, SI-LLM achieves promising end-to-end results, as well as
better or comparable results to state-of-the-art methods at each step. All

CRouting: Reducing Expensive Distance Calls in Graph-Based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search,"Zhenxin Li, Shuibing He, Jiahao Guo, Xuechen Zhang, Xian-He Sun, Gang Chen",2025-08-30,2509.00365v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00365v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00365v1,databases,cs.DB,"Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a crucial problem in
information retrieval and AI applications. Recently, there has been a surge of
interest in graph-based ANNS algorithms due to their superior efficiency and
accuracy. However, the repeated computation of distances in high-dimensional
spaces constitutes the primary time cost of graph-based methods. To accelerate
the search, we propose a novel routing strategy named CRouting, which bypasses
unnecessary distance computations by exploiting the angle distributions of
high-dimensional vectors. CRouting is designed as a plugin to optimize existing
graph-based search with minimal code modifications. Our experiments show that
CRouting reduces the number of distance computations by up to 41.5% and boosts
queries per second by up to 1.48$\times$ on two predominant graph indexes, HNSW
and NSG. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ISCS-ZJU/CRouting.",https://github.com/ISCS-ZJU/CRouting,
