JointRank: Rank Large Set with Single Pass,Evgeny Dedov,2025-06-27,2506.22262v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22262v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22262v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Efficiently ranking relevant items from large candidate pools is a
cornerstone of modern information retrieval systems -- such as web search,
recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation. Listwise rerankers, which
improve relevance by jointly considering multiple candidates, are often limited
in practice: either by model input size constraints, or by degraded quality
when processing large sets. We propose a model-agnostic method for fast
reranking large sets that exceed a model input limits. The method first
partitions candidate items into overlapping blocks, each of which is ranked
independently in parallel. Implicit pairwise comparisons are then derived from
these local rankings. Finally, these comparisons are aggregated to construct a
global ranking using algorithms such as Winrate or PageRank. Experiments on
TREC DL-2019 show that our method achieves an nDCG@10 of 70.88 compared to the
57.68 for full-context listwise approach using gpt-4.1-mini as long-context
model, while reducing latency from 21 to 8 seconds.

Small Encoders Can Rival Large Decoders in Detecting Groundedness,"Istabrak Abbes, Gabriele Prato, Quentin Fournier, Fernando Rodriguez, Alaa Boukhary, Adam Elwood, Sarath Chandar",2025-06-26,2506.21288v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21288v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21288v1,information_retrieval,cs.CL,"Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

Conformal-RAG leverages CP and internal information from the RAG mechanism to

conformal sets, making it suitable for complex RAG applications. Compared to
existing RAG auto-evaluation methods, Conformal-RAG offers statistical

without the need for ground truth answers. Additionally, our experiments
demonstrate that by leveraging information from the RAG system, Conformal-RAG

but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This
critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from
their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes
reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we
propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel
framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically,
we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to
perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a
modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for
reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially
boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially
on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised
fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities.
We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and
DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned

ushering in a new paradigm termed Agentic Deep Research. These systems
transcend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating
autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a
dynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to
interactive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also

information retrievers through query rewriting. However, for challenging
corpora, we argue that enhancing queries alone is insufficient for robust
semantic matching; the LLM should also have sufficient understanding of the
corpus by directly handling and augmenting the documents themselves. To this
end, we present an LLM-based retriever empowered to augment both user queries
and corpus documents, with its policy fully explored via reinforcement learning
(RL) and minimal human inductive bias. Notably, we find that simply allowing
the LLM to modify documents yields little benefit unless paired with our
carefully designed bidirectional RL framework, which enables the LLM to
simultaneously learn and collaborate on both query and document augmentation
policies. A key technical challenge in realizing such a framework lies in
jointly updating both policies during training, where the rewards for the two
directions depend on each other, making their entangled reward intractable. Our
approach addresses this by introducing a reward sampling strategy and a
specifically designed RL algorithm that enables effective training with these
sampled rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances LLM-based retrieval performance in both sparse and dense
settings, particularly in difficult retrieval domains, and achieves strong

HPC-ColPali, a Hierarchical Patch Compression framework that enhances the
efficiency of ColPali while preserving its retrieval accuracy. Our approach
integrates three innovative techniques: (1) K-Means quantization, which
compresses patch embeddings into 1-byte centroid indices, achieving up to
32$\times$ storage reduction; (2) attention-guided dynamic pruning, utilizing
Vision-Language Model attention weights to retain only the top-$p\%$ most
salient patches, reducing late-interaction computation by up to 60\% with less

distance-based similarity search for resource-constrained environments.
Evaluated on the ViDoRe and SEC-Filings datasets, HPC-ColPali achieves 30--50\%
lower query latency under HNSW indexing while maintaining high retrieval
precision. When integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for
legal summarization, it reduces hallucination rates by 30\% and halves
