PRISM: Personalized Recommendation via Information Synergy Module,"Xinyi Zhang, Yutong Li, Peijie Sun, Letian Sha, Zhongxuan Han",2026-01-16,2601.10944v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10944v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10944v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Multimodal sequential recommendation (MSR) leverages diverse item modalities to improve recommendation accuracy, while achieving effective and adaptive fusion remains challenging. Existing MSR models often overlook synergistic information that emerges only through modality combinations. Moreover, they typically assume a fixed importance for different modality interactions across users. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{P}ersonalized \textbf{R}ecommend-ation via \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{S}ynergy \textbf{M}odule (PRISM), a plug-and-play framework for sequential recommendation (SR). PRISM explicitly decomposes multimodal information into unique, redundant, and synergistic components through an Interaction Expert Layer and dynamically weights them via an Adaptive Fusion Layer guided by user preferences. This information-theoretic design enables fine-grained disentanglement and personalized fusion of multimodal signals. Extensive experiments on four datasets and three SR backbones demonstrate its effectiveness and versatility.

Tail-Aware Data Augmentation for Long-Tail Sequential Recommendation,"Yizhou Dang, Zhifu Wei, Minhan Huang, Lianbo Ma, Jianzhe Zhao, Guibing Guo, Xingwei Wang",2026-01-16,2601.10933v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10933v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10933v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Sequential recommendation (SR) learns user preferences based on their historical interaction sequences and provides personalized suggestions. In real-world scenarios, most users can only interact with a handful of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. This pervasive long-tail challenge limits the model's ability to learn user preferences. Despite previous efforts to enrich tail items/users with knowledge from head parts or improve tail learning through additional contextual information, they still face the following issues: 1) They struggle to improve the situation where interactions of tail users/items are scarce, leading to incomplete preferences learning for the tail parts. 2) Existing methods often degrade overall or head parts performance when improving accuracy for tail users/items, thereby harming the user experience. We propose Tail-Aware Data Augmentation (TADA) for long-tail sequential recommendation, which enhances the interaction frequency for tail items/users while maintaining head performance, thereby promoting the model's learning capabilities for the tail. Specifically, we first capture the co-occurrence and correlation among low-popularity items by a linear model. Building upon this, we design two tail-aware augmentation operators, T-Substitute and T-Insert. The former replaces the head item with a relevant item, while the latter utilizes co-occurrence relationships to extend the original sequence by incorporating both head and tail items. The augmented and original sequences are mixed at the representation level to preserve preference knowledge. We further extend the mix operation across different tail-user sequences and augmented sequences to generate richer augmented samples, thereby improving tail performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. The codes are provided at https://github.com/KingGugu/TADA.",https://github.com/KingGugu/TADA,Accepted by WWW 2026

RAG systems are often dynamic and may involve multiple rounds of retrieval. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are available through academic IR platforms, these platforms are typically designed for the Cranfield paradigm in which all queries are known up front and can be batch processed offline. This simplification accelerates research but leaves state-of-the-art retrieval models unable to support downstream applications that require online services, such as arbitrary dynamic RAG pipelines that involve looping, feedback, or even self-organizing agents. In this work, we introduce RoutIR, a Python package that provides a simple and efficient HTTP API that wraps arbitrary retrieval methods, including first stage retrieval, reranking, query expansion, and result fusion. By providing a minimal JSON configuration file specifying the retrieval models to serve, RoutIR can be used to construct and query retrieval pipelines on-the-fly using any permutation of available models (e.g., fusing the results of several first-stage retrieval methods followed by reranking). The API automatically performs asynchronous query batching and caches results by default. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are already supported by the package, RoutIR is also easily expandable by implementing the Engine abstract class.

We identify the lack of {\itshape need-to-modify} itinerary data as the critical bottleneck hindering research on this task and propose a general pipeline to overcome it. This pipeline frames the generation of such data as an intent-driven perturbation task. It instructs large language models to perturb real world itineraries using three atomic editing operations: REPLACE, ADD, and DELETE. Each perturbation is grounded in three intents, including disruptions of popularity, spatial distance, and category diversity. Furthermore, a hybrid evaluation metric is designed to ensure perturbation effectiveness.

However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\% of the training data.

Bridging Semantic Understanding and Popularity Bias with LLMs,"Renqiang Luo, Dong Zhang, Yupeng Gao, Wen Shi, Mingliang Hou, Jiaying Liu, Zhe Wang, Shuo Yu",2026-01-14,2601.09478v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09478v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.09478v2,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Semantic understanding of popularity bias is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in recommender systems, where popular items are often favored at the expense of niche content. Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as ""diversity"" or ""debiasing"", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias.

Why not Collaborative Filtering in Dual View?

However, these approaches suffer from a critical limitation: our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ceiling when modeling unpopular items, where parameter-based dense models experience diminishing SNR under severe data sparsity. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SaD (Sparse and Dense), a unified framework that integrates the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the structural reliability of sparse interaction patterns. We theoretically show that aligning these dual views yields a strictly superior global SNR. Concretely, SaD introduces a lightweight bidirectional alignment mechanism: the dense view enriches the sparse view by injecting semantic correlations, while the sparse view regularizes the dense model through explicit structural signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under this dual-view alignment, even a simple matrix factorization--style dense model can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, SaD is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of existing recommender models, highlighting the enduring power of collaborative filtering when leveraged from dual perspectives. Further evaluations on real-world benchmarks show that SaD consistently outperforms strong baselines, ranking first on the BarsMatch leaderboard.

While existing methods attempt to fuse these heterogeneous signals, they inherently lack a principled mechanism to ensure robustness against such behavioral inconsistency.
  In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Behavior Recommendation towards Target Behaviors (RMBRec), a robust multi-behavior recommendation framework grounded in an information-theoretic robustness principle. We interpret robustness as a joint process of maximizing predictive information while minimizing its variance across heterogeneous behavioral environments. Under this perspective, the Representation Robustness Module (RRM) enhances local semantic consistency by maximizing the mutual information between users' auxiliary and target representations, whereas the Optimization Robustness Module (ORM) enforces global stability by minimizing the variance of predictive risks across behaviors, which is an efficient approximation to invariant risk minimization. This local-global collaboration bridges representation purification and optimization invariance in a theoretically coherent way.

We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.

Existing imputation methods emphasize trajectory recovery, paying limited attention to interpretability and failing to provide underlying knowledge that benefits downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and route planning. We propose knowledge-driven interpretable vessel trajectory imputation (VISTA), the first trajectory imputation framework that offers interpretability while simultaneously providing underlying knowledge to support downstream analysis. Specifically, we first define underlying knowledge as a combination of Structured Data-derived Knowledge (SDK) distilled from AIS data and Implicit LLM Knowledge acquired from large-scale Internet corpora. Second, to manage and leverage the SDK effectively at scale, we develop a data-knowledge-data loop that employs a Structured Data-derived Knowledge Graph for SDK extraction and knowledge-driven trajectory imputation. Third, to efficiently process large-scale AIS data, we introduce a workflow management layer that coordinates the end-to-end pipeline, enabling parallel knowledge extraction and trajectory imputation with anomaly handling and redundancy elimination. Experiments on two large AIS datasets show that VISTA is capable of state-of-the-art imputation accuracy and computational efficiency, improving over state-of-the-art baselines by 5%-94% and reducing time cost by 51%-93%, while producing interpretable knowledge cues that benefit downstream tasks.

Octopus: A Lightweight Entity-Aware System for Multi-Table Data Discovery and Cell-Level Retrieval,"Wen-Zhi Li, Sainyam Galhotra",2026-01-05,2601.02304v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02304v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02304v1,databases,cs.DB,"Tabular data constitute a dominant form of information in modern data lakes and repositories, yet discovering the relevant tables to answer user questions remains challenging. Existing data discovery systems assume that each question can be answered by a single table and often rely on resource-intensive offline preprocessing, such as model training or large-scale content indexing. In practice, however, many questions require information spread across multiple tables -- either independently or through joins -- and users often seek specific cell values rather than entire tables. In this paper, we present Octopus, a lightweight, entity-aware, and training-free system for multi-table data discovery and cell-level value retrieval. Instead of embedding entire questions, Octopus identifies fine-grained entities (column mentions and value mentions) from natural-language queries using an LLM parser. It then matches these entities to table headers through a compact embedding index and scans table contents directly for value occurrences, eliminating the need for heavy content indexing or costly offline stages. The resulting fine-grained alignment not only improves table retrieval accuracy but also facilitates efficient downstream NL2SQL execution by reducing token usage and redundant LLM calls. To evaluate Octopus, we introduce a new benchmark covering both table- and cell-level discovery under multi-table settings, including five datasets for independent discovery and two for join-based discovery. Experimental results show that Octopus consistently outperforms existing systems while achieving substantially lower computational and token costs.

Accelerating Storage-Based Training for Graph Neural Networks,"Myung-Hwan Jang, Jeong-Min Park, Yunyong Ko, Sang-Wook Kim",2026-01-04,2601.01473v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01473v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01473v2,databases,cs.LG,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved breakthroughs in various real-world downstream tasks due to their powerful expressiveness. As the scale of real-world graphs has been continuously growing, a storage-based approach to GNN training has been studied, which leverages external storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs) to handle such web-scale graphs on a single machine. Although such storage-based GNN training methods have shown promising potential in large-scale GNN training, we observed that they suffer from a severe bottleneck in data preparation since they overlook a critical challenge: how to handle a large number of small storage I/Os. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel storage-based GNN training framework, named AGNES, that employs a method of block-wise storage I/O processing to fully utilize the I/O bandwidth of high-performance storage devices. Moreover, to further enhance the efficiency of each storage I/O, AGNES employs a simple yet effective strategy, hyperbatch-based processing based on the characteristics of real-world graphs. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world graphs reveal that AGNES consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods, by up to 4.1X faster than the best competitor.

For edge storage, it employs a hybrid snapshot-log architecture that enables amortized $O(1)$ update time. RadixGraph supports millions of concurrent updates per second while maintaining competitive performance for graph analytics.

Exploring the Heterogeneity of Tabular Data: A Diversity-aware Data Generator via LLMs,"Yafeng Tang, Xiaoou Ding, Jianzhuo Du, Zishuo Yan, Zhuang Ma, Zheng Liang, Zekai Qian, Hongzhi Wang",2025-12-26,2512.21915v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21915v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21915v1,databases,cs.LG,"Tabular data generation has become increasingly essential for enabling robust machine learning applications, which require large-scale, high-quality data. Existing solutions leverage generative models to learn original data distributions. However, real-world data are naturally heterogeneous with diverse distributions, making it challenging to obtain a universally good model for diverse data generation. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Tabular data gEnerator (DATE), a framework that (i) prepares high-quality and distributionally distinct examples for in-context learning by effectively partitioning the original heterogeneous data into multiple diverse subsets; (ii) harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the diversity of the partitioned distribution with decision tree reasoning as feedback, generating high-quality labeled data for each subset. However, the massive generated data inherently involves a trade-off between diversity and quality. To integrate this issue, existing solutions greedily select the validation-best data. However, we prove that the selection in heterogeneous settings does not possess the greedy-choice property, and design a Multi-Arm Bandit-based sampling algorithm that balances the diversity and quality of generated data. Extensive experiments on tabular classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that DATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods. On average, DATE achieves a 23.75% reduction in error rate with just 100 generated data. Empirically, we demonstrate that data generated by DATE can improve the accuracy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs on the target data.

Valori: A Deterministic Memory Substrate for AI Systems,Varshith Gudur,2025-12-25,2512.22280v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22280v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22280v1,databases,cs.LG,"Modern AI systems rely on vector embeddings stored and searched using floating-point arithmetic. While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms. We demonstrate that non-determinism arises before indexing or retrieval and show how Valori enforces determinism at the memory boundary. Our results suggest that deterministic memory is a necessary primitive for trustworthy AI systems.
