    "abstract": "In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the\nprinciple of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on\npractice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal\nworkflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking\nabilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural\nlanguage help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by\na dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts\nself-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into\nconcise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts.\nBesides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent\nknowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its\nability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual,\ndata-driven process as \\textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent\nincrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing\nmodel parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging\nknowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp,\nMetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or\nexceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving\nagentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery.

    "abstract": "The connection between music and lyrics is far beyond semantic bonds.\nConceptual pairs in the two modalities such as rhythm and rhyme, note duration\nand syllabic stress, and structure correspondence, raise a compelling yet\nseldom-explored direction in the field of music information retrieval. In this\npaper, we present melody-lyrics matching (MLM), a new task which retrieves\npotential lyrics for a given symbolic melody from text sources. Rather than\ngenerating lyrics from scratch, MLM essentially exploits the relationships\nbetween melody and lyrics. We propose a self-supervised representation learning\nframework with contrastive alignment loss for melody and lyrics. This has the\npotential to leverage the abundance of existing songs with paired melody and\nlyrics. No alignment annotations are required. Additionally, we introduce\nsylphone, a novel representation for lyrics at syllable-level activated by\nphoneme identity and vowel stress. We demonstrate that our method can match\nmelody with coherent and singable lyrics with empirical results and intuitive\nexamples.

    "abstract": "Time intervals between purchasing items are a crucial factor in sequential\nrecommendation tasks, whereas existing approaches focus on item sequences and\noften overlook by assuming the intervals between items are static. However,\ndynamic intervals serve as a dimension that describes user profiling on not\nonly the history within a user but also different users with the same item\nhistory. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that\nintegrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel\ninterval-infused attention to jointly consider information of items and\nintervals. Furthermore, unlike prior studies that address the cold-start\nscenario only from the perspectives of users and items, we introduce a new\nviewpoint: the interval perspective to serve as an additional metric for\nevaluating recommendation methods on the warm and cold scenarios. Extensive\nexperiments on 3 benchmarks with both traditional- and LLM-based baselines\ndemonstrate that our IntervalLLM achieves not only 4.4% improvements in average\nbut also the best-performing warm and cold scenarios across all users, items,\nand the proposed interval perspectives. In addition, we observe that the cold\nscenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant\nperformance drop among all recommendation methods. This finding underscores the\nnecessity of further research on interval-based cold challenges and our\nintegration of interval information in the realm of sequential recommendation\ntasks.

    "abstract": "Generative recommendation (GR) has gained increasing attention for its\npromising performance compared to traditional models. A key factor contributing\nto the success of GR is the semantic ID (SID), which converts continuous\nsemantic representations (e.g., from large language models) into discrete ID\nsequences. This enables GR models with SIDs to both incorporate semantic\ninformation and learn collaborative filtering signals, while retaining the\nbenefits of discrete decoding. However, varied modeling techniques,\nhyper-parameters, and experimental setups in existing literature make direct\ncomparisons between GR proposals challenging. Furthermore, the absence of an\nopen-source, unified framework hinders systematic benchmarking and extension,\nslowing model iteration. To address this challenge, our work introduces and\nopen-sources a framework for Generative Recommendation with semantic ID, namely\nGRID, specifically designed for modularity to facilitate easy component\nswapping and accelerate idea iteration. Using GRID, we systematically\nexperiment with and ablate different components of GR models with SIDs on\npublic benchmarks. Our comprehensive experiments with GRID reveal that many\noverlooked architectural components in GR models with SIDs substantially impact\nperformance. This offers both novel insights and validates the utility of an\nopen-source platform for robust benchmarking and GR research advancement.

Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is\ncritical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have\nequipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing\nthem to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by\nthis ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that\nexplicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming\nto enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We\nvalidate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the\nretriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA\ndatasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG\nperformance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,\nwhere the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,\nwhere it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently\nimproves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can\nalso effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that\nincorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for\nbuilding more robust RAG systems.

While deep\nlearning models have improved optical-assisted diagnostics, they often demand\nextensive labeled datasets and yield \"black-box\" outputs with limited\ninterpretability. In this paper, we propose EndoFinder, an online polyp\nretrieval framework that leverages multi-view scene representations for\nexplainable and scalable CRC diagnosis. First, we develop a Polyp-aware Image\nEncoder by combining contrastive learning and a reconstruction task, guided by\npolyp segmentation masks. This self-supervised approach captures robust\nfeatures without relying on large-scale annotated data. Next, we treat each\npolyp as a three-dimensional \"scene\" and introduce a Scene Representation\nTransformer, which fuses multiple views of the polyp into a single latent\nrepresentation. By discretizing this representation through a hashing layer,\nEndoFinder enables real-time retrieval from a compiled database of historical\npolyp cases, where diagnostic information serves as interpretable references\nfor new queries. We evaluate EndoFinder on both public and newly collected\npolyp datasets for re-identification and pathology classification. Results show\nthat EndoFinder outperforms existing methods in accuracy while providing\ntransparent, retrieval-based insights for clinical decision-making.

It uses available\ntabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage\n``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding\nnatural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,\nwe introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)\nLLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)\nobjective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We\nevaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results\nreveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,\nthey struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,\nmodels presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this\ninformation becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We\nrelease a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline\nextraction systems, to support continued research.",

    "abstract": "Location-tracking data from the Automatic Identification System, much of\nwhich is publicly available, plays a key role in a range of maritime safety and\nmonitoring applications. However, the data suffers from missing values that\nhamper downstream applications. Imputing the missing values is challenging\nbecause the values of different heterogeneous attributes are updated at diverse\nrates, resulting in the occurrence of multi-scale dependencies among\nattributes. Existing imputation methods that assume similar update rates across\nattributes are unable to capture and exploit such dependencies, limiting their\nimputation accuracy. We propose MH-GIN, a Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based\nImputation Network that aims improve imputation accuracy by capturing\nmulti-scale dependencies. Specifically, MH-GIN first extracts multi-scale\ntemporal features for each attribute while preserving their intrinsic\nheterogeneous characteristics. Then, it constructs a multi-scale heterogeneous\ngraph to explicitly model dependencies between heterogeneous attributes to\nenable more accurate imputation of missing values through graph propagation.\nExperimental results on two real-world datasets find that MH-GIN is capable of\nan average 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, while maintaining computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "To address the challenges posed by cascading reactions caused by component\nfailures in autonomous cargo ships (ACS) and the uncertainties in emergency\ndecision-making, this paper proposes a novel hybrid feature fusion framework\nfor constructing a graph-structured dataset of failure modes. By employing an\nimproved cuckoo search algorithm (HN-CSA), the literature retrieval efficiency\nis significantly enhanced, achieving improvements of 7.1% and 3.4% compared to\nthe NSGA-II and CSA search algorithms, respectively. A hierarchical feature\nfusion framework is constructed, using Word2Vec encoding to encode\nsubsystem/component features, BERT-KPCA to process failure modes/reasons, and\nSentence-BERT to quantify the semantic association between failure impact and\nemergency decision-making. The dataset covers 12 systems, 1,262 failure modes,\nand 6,150 propagation paths. Validation results show that the GATE-GNN model\nachieves a classification accuracy of 0.735, comparable to existing benchmarks.\nAdditionally, a silhouette coefficient of 0.641 indicates that the features are\nhighly distinguishable. In the label prediction results, the Shore-based\nMeteorological Service System achieved an F1 score of 0.93, demonstrating high\nprediction accuracy. This paper not only provides a solid foundation for\nfailure analysis in autonomous cargo ships but also offers reliable support for\nfault diagnosis, risk assessment, and intelligent decision-making systems.

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges in enterprise data analysis is the task of\nfinding joinable tables that are conceptually related and provide meaningful\ninsights. Traditionally, joinable tables have been discovered through a search\nfor similar columns, where two columns are considered similar syntactically if\nthere is a set overlap or they are considered similar semantically if either\nthe column embeddings or value embeddings are closer in the embedding space.\nHowever, for enterprise data lakes, column similarity is not sufficient to\nidentify joinable columns and tables. The context of the query column is\nimportant. Hence, in this work, we first define context-aware column\njoinability. Then we propose a multi-criteria approach, called TOPJoin, for\njoinable column search. We evaluate TOPJoin against existing join search\nbaselines over one academic and one real-world join search benchmark. Through\nexperiments, we find that TOPJoin performs better on both benchmarks than the\nbaselines.",
