Time-Aware Adaptive Side Information Fusion for Sequential Recommendation,"Jie Luo, Wenyu Zhang, Xinming Zhang, Yuan Fang",2025-12-30,2512.24246v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24246v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24246v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Incorporating item-side information, such as category and brand, into sequential recommendation is a well-established and effective approach for improving performance. However, despite significant advancements, current models are generally limited by three key challenges: they often overlook the fine-grained temporal dynamics inherent in timestamps, exhibit vulnerability to noise in user interaction sequences, and rely on computationally expensive fusion architectures. To systematically address these challenges, we propose the Time-Aware Adaptive Side Information Fusion (TASIF) framework. TASIF integrates three synergistic components: (1) a simple, plug-and-play time span partitioning mechanism to capture global temporal patterns; (2) an adaptive frequency filter that leverages a learnable gate to denoise feature sequences adaptively, thereby providing higher-quality inputs for subsequent fusion modules; and (3) an efficient adaptive side information fusion layer, this layer employs a ""guide-not-mix"" architecture, where attributes guide the attention mechanism without being mixed into the content-representing item embeddings, ensuring deep interaction while ensuring computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that TASIF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining excellent efficiency in training.

AutoPP: Towards Automated Product Poster Generation and Optimization,"Jiahao Fan, Yuxin Qin, Wei Feng, Yanyin Chen, Yaoyu Li, Ao Ma, Yixiu Li, Li Zhuang, Haoyi Bian, Zheng Zhang, Jingjing Lv, Junjie Shen, Ching Law",2025-12-26,2512.21921v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21921v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21921v1,information_retrieval,cs.CV,"Product posters blend striking visuals with informative text to highlight the product and capture customer attention. However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users. Experiments demonstrate that AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings.

Although KG20C has been available online in non-peer-reviewed sources such as GitHub repository, this paper provides the first formal, peer-reviewed description of the dataset, including clear documentation of its construction and specifications. KG20C-QA is built upon KG20C to support QA tasks on scholarly data. We define a set of QA templates that convert graph triples into natural language question--answer pairs, producing a benchmark that can be used both with graph-based models such as knowledge graph embeddings and with text-based models such as large language models. We benchmark standard knowledge graph embedding methods on KG20C-QA, analyze performance across relation types, and provide reproducible evaluation protocols. By officially releasing these datasets with thorough documentation, we aim to contribute a reusable, extensible resource for the research community, enabling future work in QA, reasoning, and knowledge-driven applications in the scholarly domain.

QuCo-RAG: Quantifying Uncertainty from the Pre-training Corpus for Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Dehai Min, Kailin Zhang, Tongtong Wu, Lu Cheng",2025-12-22,2512.19134v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19134v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19134v1,information_retrieval,cs.CL,"Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation adaptively determines when to retrieve during generation to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods rely on model-internal signals (e.g., logits, entropy), which are fundamentally unreliable because LLMs are typically ill-calibrated and often exhibit high confidence in erroneous outputs. We propose QuCo-RAG, which shifts from subjective confidence to objective statistics computed from pre-training data. Our method quantifies uncertainty through two stages: (1) before generation, we identify low-frequency entities indicating long-tail knowledge gaps; (2) during generation, we verify entity co-occurrence in the pre-training corpus, where zero co-occurrence often signals hallucination risk. Both stages leverage Infini-gram for millisecond-latency queries over 4 trillion tokens, triggering retrieval when uncertainty is high. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show QuCo-RAG achieves EM gains of 5--12 points over state-of-the-art baselines with OLMo-2 models, and transfers effectively to models with undisclosed pre-training data (Llama, Qwen, GPT), improving EM by up to 14 points. Domain generalization on biomedical QA further validates the robustness of our paradigm. These results establish corpus-grounded verification as a principled, practically model-agnostic paradigm for dynamic RAG.

Efficient Optimization of Hierarchical Identifiers for Generative Recommendation,"Federica Valeau, Odysseas Boufalis, Polytimi Gkotsi, Joshua Rosenthal, David Vos",2025-12-20,2512.18434v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18434v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18434v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"SEATER is a generative retrieval model that improves recommendation inference efficiency and retrieval quality by utilizing balanced tree-structured item identifiers and contrastive training objectives. We reproduce and validate SEATER's reported improvements in retrieval quality over strong baselines across all datasets from the original work, and extend the evaluation to Yambda, a large-scale music recommendation dataset. Our experiments verify SEATER's strong performance, but show that its tree construction step during training becomes a major bottleneck as the number of items grows. To address this, we implement and evaluate two alternative construction algorithms: a greedy method optimized for minimal build time, and a hybrid method that combines greedy clustering at high levels with more precise grouping at lower levels. The greedy method reduces tree construction time to less than 2% of the original with only a minor drop in quality on the dataset with the largest item collection. The hybrid method achieves retrieval quality on par with the original, and even improves on the largest dataset, while cutting construction time to just 5-8%.

The current release covers over 60K models and 90K tables. To evaluate model and table relatedness, we construct a multi source ground truth using three complementary signals: (1) paper citation links, (2) explicit model card links and inheritance, and (3) shared training datasets. We present one extensive empirical use case for the benchmark which is table search. We compare canonical Data Lake search operators (unionable, joinable, keyword) and Information Retrieval baselines (dense, sparse, hybrid retrieval) on this benchmark. Union based semantic table retrieval attains 54.8 % P@1 overall (54.6 % on citation, 31.3 % on inheritance, 30.6 % on shared dataset signals); table based dense retrieval reaches 66.5 % P@1, and metadata hybrid retrieval achieves 54.1 %.

Exploring the Heterogeneity of Tabular Data: A Diversity-aware Data Generator via LLMs,"Yafeng Tang, Xiaoou Ding, Jianzhuo Du, Zishuo Yan, Zhuang Ma, Zheng Liang, Zekai Qian, Hongzhi Wang",2025-12-26,2512.21915v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21915v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21915v1,databases,cs.LG,"Tabular data generation has become increasingly essential for enabling robust machine learning applications, which require large-scale, high-quality data. Existing solutions leverage generative models to learn original data distributions. However, real-world data are naturally heterogeneous with diverse distributions, making it challenging to obtain a universally good model for diverse data generation. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Tabular data gEnerator (DATE), a framework that (i) prepares high-quality and distributionally distinct examples for in-context learning by effectively partitioning the original heterogeneous data into multiple diverse subsets; (ii) harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the diversity of the partitioned distribution with decision tree reasoning as feedback, generating high-quality labeled data for each subset. However, the massive generated data inherently involves a trade-off between diversity and quality. To integrate this issue, existing solutions greedily select the validation-best data. However, we prove that the selection in heterogeneous settings does not possess the greedy-choice property, and design a Multi-Arm Bandit-based sampling algorithm that balances the diversity and quality of generated data. Extensive experiments on tabular classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that DATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods. On average, DATE achieves a 23.75% reduction in error rate with just 100 generated data. Empirically, we demonstrate that data generated by DATE can improve the accuracy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs on the target data.

Valori: A Deterministic Memory Substrate for AI Systems,Varshith Gudur,2025-12-25,2512.22280v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22280v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22280v1,databases,cs.LG,"Modern AI systems rely on vector embeddings stored and searched using floating-point arithmetic. While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms. We demonstrate that non-determinism arises before indexing or retrieval and show how Valori enforces determinism at the memory boundary. Our results suggest that deterministic memory is a necessary primitive for trustworthy AI systems.

A Multi-agent Text2SQL Framework using Small Language Models and Execution Feedback,"Thanh Dat Hoang, Thanh Trung Huynh, Matthias Weidlich, Thanh Tam Nguyen, Tong Chen, Hongzhi Yin, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen",2025-12-21,2512.18622v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18622v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18622v1,databases,cs.DB,"Text2SQL, the task of generating SQL queries from natural language text, is a critical challenge in data engineering. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior performance for this task due to their advanced comprehension and generation capabilities. However, privacy and cost considerations prevent companies from using Text2SQL solutions based on external LLMs offered as a service. Rather, small LLMs (SLMs) that are openly available and can hosted in-house are adopted. These SLMs, in turn, lack the generalization capabilities of larger LLMs, which impairs their effectiveness for complex tasks such as Text2SQL. To address these limitations, we propose MATS, a novel Text2SQL framework designed specifically for SLMs. MATS uses a multi-agent mechanism that assigns specialized roles to auxiliary agents, reducing individual workloads and fostering interaction. A training scheme based on reinforcement learning aligns these agents using feedback obtained during execution, thereby maintaining competitive performance despite a limited LLM size. Evaluation results using on benchmark datasets show that MATS, deployed on a single- GPU server, yields accuracy that are on-par with large-scale LLMs when using significantly fewer parameters.

Scaling Text2SQL via LLM-efficient Schema Filtering with Functional Dependency Graph Rerankers,"Thanh Dat Hoang, Thanh Tam Nguyen, Thanh Trung Huynh, Hongzhi Yin, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen",2025-12-18,2512.16083v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16083v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16083v1,databases,cs.DB,"Most modern Text2SQL systems prompt large language models (LLMs) with entire schemas -- mostly column information -- alongside the user's question. While effective on small databases, this approach fails on real-world schemas that exceed LLM context limits, even for commercial models. The recent Spider 2.0 benchmark exemplifies this with hundreds of tables and tens of thousands of columns, where existing systems often break. Current mitigations either rely on costly multi-step prompting pipelines or filter columns by ranking them against user's question independently, ignoring inter-column structure. To scale existing systems, we introduce \toolname, an open-source, LLM-efficient schema filtering framework that compacts Text2SQL prompts by (i) ranking columns with a query-aware LLM encoder enriched with values and metadata, (ii) reranking inter-connected columns via a lightweight graph transformer over functional dependencies, and (iii) selecting a connectivity-preserving sub-schema with a Steiner-tree heuristic. Experiments on real datasets show that \toolname achieves near-perfect recall and higher precision than CodeS, SchemaExP, Qwen rerankers, and embedding retrievers, while maintaining sub-second median latency and scaling to schemas with 23,000+ columns.

With the growing demand for predictive analytics, the deep integration of machine learning (ML) into RDBMS has become critical. However, a fundamental challenge hinders this evolution: conventional ML models are static and task-specific, whereas RDBMS environments are dynamic and must support diverse analytical queries. Each analytical task entails constructing a bespoke pipeline from scratch, which incurs significant development overhead and hence limits wide adoption of ML in analytics.
  We present NeurIDA, an autonomous end-to-end system for in-database analytics that dynamically ""tweaks"" the best available base model to better serve a given analytical task. In particular, we propose a novel paradigm of dynamic in-database modeling to pre-train a composable base model architecture over the relational data. Upon receiving a task, NeurIDA formulates the task and data profile to dynamically select and configure relevant components from the pool of base models and shared model components for prediction. For friendly user experience, NeurIDA supports natural language queries; it interprets user intent to construct structured task profiles, and generates analytical reports with dedicated LLM agents. By design, NeurIDA enables ease-of-use and yet effective and efficient in-database AI analytics. Extensive experiment study shows that NeurIDA consistently delivers up to 12% improvement in AUC-ROC and 25% relative reduction in MAE across ten tasks on five real-world datasets.
