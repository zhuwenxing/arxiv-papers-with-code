HierSearch: A Hierarchical Enterprise Deep Search Framework Integrating Local and Web Searches,"Jiejun Tan, Zhicheng Dou, Yan Yu, Jiehan Cheng, Qiang Ju, Jian Xie, Ji-Rong Wen",2025-08-11,2508.08088v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08088v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08088v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Recently, large reasoning models have demonstrated strong mathematical and
coding abilities, and deep search leverages their reasoning capabilities in
challenging information retrieval tasks. Existing deep search works are
generally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web.
However, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can
leverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an
agent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning
(RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data
efficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we
propose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with
hierarchical RL. At the low level, a local deep search agent and a Web deep
search agent are trained to retrieve evidence from their corresponding domains.
At the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides
the final answer. Moreover, to prevent direct answer copying and error
propagation, we design a knowledge refiner that filters out hallucinations and
irrelevant evidence returned by low-level agents. Experiments show that
HierSearch achieves better performance compared to flat RL, and outperforms
various deep search and multi-source retrieval-augmented generation baselines
in six benchmarks across general, finance, and medical domains.",https://github.com/plageon/HierSearch,"Code and datasets are available at

scenarios, where new items with a limited history of interaction need to be
effectively recommended to users. Though multimodal data (e.g., images, text,
audio, etc.) offer rich information to address this issue, existing approaches
often employ simplistic integration methods such as concatenation, average
pooling, or fixed weighting schemes, which fail to capture the complex
relationships between modalities. Our study proposes a novel Mixture of Experts
(MoE) framework for multimodal cold-start recommendation, named MAMEX, which
dynamically leverages latent representation from different modalities. MAMEX
utilizes modality-specific expert networks and introduces a learnable gating
mechanism that adaptively weights the contribution of each modality based on
its content characteristics. This approach enables MAMEX to emphasize the most
informative modalities for each item while maintaining robustness when certain
modalities are less relevant or missing. Extensive experiments on benchmark

challenge, particularly for named entity recognition (NER) in the architecture,
engineering, and construction (AEC) domain to support automated rule checking
(ARC). The performance of standard pre-trained models is often constrained by
the domain gap, as they struggle to interpret the specialized terminology and
complex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be
mitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as
exemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and
cost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative. However,
the optimal strategy for generating knowledge that can genuinely enhance
smaller, efficient models remains an open question. To address this, we propose
ARCE (augmented RoBERTa with contextualized elucidations), a novel approach
that systematically explores and optimizes this generation process. ARCE
employs an LLM to first generate a corpus of simple, direct explanations, which
we term Cote, and then uses this corpus to incrementally pre-train a RoBERTa
model prior to its fine-tuning on the downstream task. Our extensive
experiments show that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark
AEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%. This result also reveals a
key finding: simple, explanation-based knowledge proves surprisingly more

performance in many passage ranking tasks. With the development of Large
Reasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning
during test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to
the scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform
poorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of
reasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we
first propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis
framework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and
applies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A
self-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data
quality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we
further propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a
reinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement.
During the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a
multi-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based

BERT4Rec, have become common baselines for sequential recommendations,
surpassing earlier neural and non-neural methods. A number of following
publications have shown that the effectiveness of these models can be improved
by, for example, slightly updating the architecture of the Transformer layers,
using better training objectives, and employing improved loss functions.
However, the additivity of these modular improvements has not been
systematically benchmarked - this is the gap we aim to close in this paper.
Through our experiments, we identify a very strong model that uses SASRec's
training objective, LiGR Transformer layers, and Sampled Softmax Loss. We call
this combination eSASRec (Enhanced SASRec). While we primarily focus on
realistic, production-like evaluation, in our preliminarily study we find that
common academic benchmarks show eSASRec to be 23% more effective compared to
the most recent state-of-the-art models, such as ActionPiece. In our main
production-like benchmark, eSASRec resides on the Pareto frontier in terms of
the accuracy-coverage tradeoff (alongside the recent industrial models HSTU and
FuXi. As the modifications compared to the original SASRec are relatively
straightforward and no extra features are needed (such as timestamps in HSTU),
we believe that eSASRec can be easily integrated into existing recommendation
pipelines and can can serve as a strong yet very simple baseline for emerging
complicated algorithms. To facilitate this, we provide the open-source

promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. A key
characteristic of this domain is repetitive listening, where users frequently
replay familiar tracks. To capture these repetition patterns, recent research
has introduced Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS), which quantify
user-specific preferences based on historical frequency. While PPS enhances
relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content,
limiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key
elements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction. To address
this limitation, we build upon RecJPQ, a Transformer-based framework initially
developed to improve scalability in large-item catalogues through sub-item
decomposition. We repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model
personalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture
shared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings - latent structures not
accessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration
of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling
explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty.
Our sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by
achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising

HiD-VAE: Interpretable Generative Recommendation via Hierarchical and Disentangled Semantic IDs,"Dengzhao Fang, Jingtong Gao, Chengcheng Zhu, Yu Li, Xiangyu Zhao, Yi Chang",2025-08-06,2508.04618v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04618v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04618v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Recommender systems are indispensable for helping users navigate the immense
item catalogs of modern online platforms. Recently, generative recommendation
has emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional
retrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic
generation. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained
by their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from
two critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking
a coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement
(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.
To overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that
learns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core
innovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization
process that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more
uniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict
hierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for
each recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE
incorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space
overlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but
also promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive
utilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled
IDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models. Extensive
experiments on three public benchmarks validate HiD-VAE's superior performance
against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods
solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the
complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to
tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally
and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval.
These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video
moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or
background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end,
we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which
learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts
for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and
audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance
predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly
assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we
design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and
visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their
complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation
strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference.
To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e.,
Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and
re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability
in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness

integrating diverse semantic information from multiple modalities. However, the
assumption of the availability of all modalities rarely holds in practice due

ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.

massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
