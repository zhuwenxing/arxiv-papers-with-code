    "abstract": "In real-world recommendation scenarios, users typically engage with platforms\nthrough multiple types of behavioral interactions. Multi-behavior\nrecommendation algorithms aim to leverage various auxiliary user behaviors to\nenhance prediction for target behaviors of primary interest (e.g., buy),\nthereby overcoming performance limitations caused by data sparsity in target\nbehavior records. Current state-of-the-art approaches typically employ\nhierarchical design following either cascading (e.g.,\nview$\\rightarrow$cart$\\rightarrow$buy) or parallel\n(unified$\\rightarrow$behavior$\\rightarrow$specific components) paradigms, to\ncapture behavioral relationships. However, these methods still face two\ncritical challenges: (1) severe distribution disparities across behaviors, and\n(2) negative transfer effects caused by noise in auxiliary behaviors. In this\npaper, we propose a novel model-agnostic Hierarchical Graph Information\nBottleneck (HGIB) framework for multi-behavior recommendation to effectively\naddress these challenges. Following information bottleneck principles, our\nframework optimizes the learning of compact yet sufficient representations that\npreserve essential information for target behavior prediction while eliminating\ntask-irrelevant redundancies. To further mitigate interaction noise, we\nintroduce a Graph Refinement Encoder (GRE) that dynamically prunes redundant\nedges through learnable edge dropout mechanisms. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world public datasets, which demonstrate the superior\neffectiveness of our framework. Beyond these widely used datasets in the\nacademic community, we further expand our evaluation on several real industrial\nscenarios and conduct an online A/B testing, showing again a significant\nimprovement in multi-behavior recommendations.

    "abstract": "Universal multimodal retrieval (UMR), which aims to address complex retrieval\ntasks where both queries and candidates span diverse modalities, has been\nsignificantly advanced by the emergence of MLLMs. While state-of-the-art\nMLLM-based methods in the literature predominantly adopt contrastive learning\nprinciples, they often differ in their specific training recipes. Despite their\nsuccess, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely\nunexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited\ngeneralization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive\nstudy aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding\nlearning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based\nembedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary\ncontributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we\nexplore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training\nstrategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and\nre-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked\nfactors can have a substantial impact on model performance.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative\ncapabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,\nand challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but\noften struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval\nstrategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by\nmetadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The\nframework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains\ntabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing\noptimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and\nconversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5\nincreased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative\nevaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness\n(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.\nThese results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,\ncomprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks.

However,\nexisting Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their\ninability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In\nthis work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph\nretrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over\ntemporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal\nambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units\n(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal\nanchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture\ntemporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event\ngraph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting\nefficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent\ngeneration, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that\nretrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time\nChain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This\nunified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event\nsequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG\nsystems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of\nthree typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more\nfaithful and temporal-aware generation.

    "abstract": "Graph knowledge has been proven effective in enhancing item rankings in\nrecommender systems (RecSys), particularly during the retrieval stage. However,\nits application in the ranking stage, especially when richer contextual\ninformation in user-item interactions is available, remains underexplored. A\nmajor challenge lies in the substantial computational cost associated with\nrepeatedly retrieving neighborhood information from billions of items stored in\ndistributed systems. This resource-intensive requirement makes it difficult to\nscale graph-based methods in practical RecSys. To bridge this gap, we first\ndemonstrate that incorporating graphs in the ranking stage improves ranking\nqualities. Notably, while the improvement is evident, we show that the\nsubstantial computational overheads entailed by graphs are prohibitively\nexpensive for real-world recommendations. In light of this, we propose a\nnon-parametric strategy that utilizes graph convolution for re-ranking only\nduring test time. Our strategy circumvents the notorious computational\noverheads from graph convolution during training, and utilizes structural\nknowledge hidden in graphs on-the-fly during testing. It can be used as a\nplug-and-play module and easily employed to enhance the ranking ability of\nvarious ranking layers of a real-world RecSys with significantly reduced\ncomputational overhead. Through comprehensive experiments across four benchmark\ndatasets with varying levels of sparsity, we demonstrate that our strategy\nyields noticeable improvements (i.e., 8.1% on average) during testing time with\nlittle to no additional computational overheads (i.e., 0.5 on average).

These approaches face significant limitations as\nthey cannot perform instant diagnosis for new learners without computationally\nexpensive retraining and produce diagnostic outputs with limited reliability.\nIn this study, we introduces a novel generative diagnosis paradigm that\nfundamentally shifts CD from predictive to generative modeling, enabling\ninductive inference of cognitive states without parameter re-optimization.

    "abstract": "Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer\nvision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face\nchallenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among\nsimilar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft\npositive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft\nnegative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching\nuncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the\nneighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training\nbatches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.\nThis paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning\nframework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified\nrepresentation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,\neffectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework\nintroduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive\naggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic\nunderstanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and\ninter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships\namong sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic\ninteractions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum\ncontrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined\nstrategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between\nfeatures.
