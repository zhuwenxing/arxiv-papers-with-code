Post-Training Fairness Control: A Single-Train Framework for Dynamic Fairness in Recommendation,"Weixin Chen, Li Chen, Yuhan Zhao",2026-01-28,2601.20848v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20848v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20848v1,information_retrieval,cs.LG,"Despite growing efforts to mitigate unfairness in recommender systems, existing fairness-aware methods typically fix the fairness requirement at training time and provide limited post-training flexibility. However, in real-world scenarios, diverse stakeholders may demand differing fairness requirements over time, so retraining for different fairness requirements becomes prohibitive. To address this limitation, we propose Cofair, a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation. Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that our framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, delivering comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need to retrain for each new fairness requirement.

MALLOC: Benchmarking the Memory-aware Long Sequence Compression for Large Sequential Recommendation,"Qihang Yu, Kairui Fu, Zhaocheng Du, Yuxuan Si, Kaiyuan Li, Weihao Zhao, Zhicheng Zhang, Jieming Zhu, Quanyu Dai, Zhenhua Dong, Shengyu Zhang, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu",2026-01-28,2601.20234v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20234v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20234v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"The scaling law, which indicates that model performance improves with increasing dataset and model capacity, has fueled a growing trend in expanding recommendation models in both industry and academia. However, the advent of large-scale recommenders also brings significantly higher computational costs, particularly under the long-sequence dependencies inherent in the user intent of recommendation systems. Current approaches often rely on pre-storing the intermediate states of the past behavior for each user, thereby reducing the quadratic re-computation cost for the following requests. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often treat memory merely as a medium for acceleration, without adequately considering the space overhead it introduces. This presents a critical challenge in real-world recommendation systems with billions of users, each of whom might initiate thousands of interactions and require massive memory for state storage. Fortunately, there have been several memory management strategies examined for compression in LLM, while most have not been evaluated on the recommendation task. To mitigate this gap, we introduce MALLOC, a comprehensive benchmark for memory-aware long sequence compression. MALLOC presents a comprehensive investigation and systematic classification of memory management techniques applicable to large sequential recommendations. These techniques are integrated into state-of-the-art recommenders, enabling a reproducible and accessible evaluation platform. Through extensive experiments across accuracy, efficiency, and complexity, we demonstrate the holistic reliability of MALLOC in advancing large-scale recommendation.

Talos: Optimizing Top-$K$ Accuracy in Recommender Systems,"Shengjia Zhang, Weiqin Yang, Jiawei Chen, Peng Wu, Yuegang Sun, Gang Wang, Qihao Shi, Can Wang",2026-01-27,2601.19276v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19276v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19276v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Recommender systems (RS) aim to retrieve a small set of items that best match individual user preferences. Naturally, RS place primary emphasis on the quality of the Top-$K$ results rather than performance across the entire item set. However, estimating Top-$K$ accuracy (e.g., Precision@$K$, Recall@$K$) requires determining the ranking positions of items, which imposes substantial computational overhead and poses significant challenges for optimization. In addition, RS often suffer from distribution shifts due to evolving user preferences or data biases, further complicating the task.
  To address these issues, we propose Talos, a loss function that is specifically designed to optimize the Talos recommendation accuracy. Talos leverages a quantile technique that replaces the complex ranking-dependent operations into simpler comparisons between predicted scores and learned score thresholds. We further develop a sampling-based regression algorithm for efficient and accurate threshold estimation, and introduce a constraint term to maintain optimization stability by preventing score inflation. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored surrogate function to address discontinuity and enhance robustness against distribution shifts. Comprehensive theoretical analyzes and empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, convergence, and distributional robustness of Talos.

The architecture of an RS model acts as an inductive bias, shaping the patterns the model is inclined to learn. In recent years, numerous recommendation architectures have emerged, spanning traditional matrix factorization, deep neural networks, and graph neural networks. However, their designs are often not explicitly aligned with the top-K objective, thereby limiting their effectiveness.
  To address this limitation, we propose TopKGAT, a novel recommendation architecture directly derived from a differentiable approximation of top-K metrics. The forward computation of a single TopKGAT layer is intrinsically aligned with the gradient ascent dynamics of the Precision@K metric, enabling the model to naturally improve top-K recommendation accuracy. Structurally, TopKGAT resembles a graph attention network and can be implemented efficiently.

DMAP: Human-Aligned Structural Document Map for Multimodal Document Understanding,"ShunLiang Fu, Yanxin Zhang, Yixin Xiang, Xiaoyu Du, Jinhui Tang",2026-01-26,2601.18203v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18203v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18203v2,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Existing multimodal document question-answering (QA) systems predominantly rely on flat semantic retrieval, representing documents as a set of disconnected text chunks and largely neglecting their intrinsic hierarchical and relational structures. Such flattening disrupts logical and spatial dependencies - such as section organization, figure-text correspondence, and cross-reference relations, that humans naturally exploit for comprehension. To address this limitation, we introduce a document-level structural Document MAP (DMAP), which explicitly encodes both hierarchical organization and inter-element relationships within multimodal documents. Specifically, we design a Structured-Semantic Understanding Agent to construct DMAP by organizing textual content together with figures, tables, charts, etc. into a human-aligned hierarchical schema that captures both semantic and layout dependencies. Building upon this representation, a Reflective Reasoning Agent performs structure-aware and evidence-driven reasoning, dynamically assessing the sufficiency of retrieved context and iteratively refining answers through targeted interactions with DMAP. Extensive experiments on MMDocQA benchmarks demonstrate that DMAP yields document-specific structural representations aligned with human interpretive patterns, substantially enhancing retrieval precision, reasoning consistency, and multimodal comprehension over conventional RAG-based approaches.

Post-Training Denoising of User Profiles with LLMs in Collaborative Filtering Recommendation,"Ervin Dervishaj, Maria Maistro, Tuukka Ruotsalo, Christina Lioma",2026-01-25,2601.18009v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18009v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18009v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Implicit feedback -- the main data source for training Recommender Systems (RSs) -- is inherently noisy and has been shown to negatively affect recommendation effectiveness. Denoising has been proposed as a method for removing noisy implicit feedback and improving recommendations. Prior work has focused on in-training denoising, however this requires additional data, changes to the model architecture and training procedure or fine-tuning, all of which can be costly and data hungry. In this work, we focus on post-training denoising. Different from in-training denoising, post-training denoising does not involve changing the architecture of the model nor its training procedure, and does not require additional data. Specifically, we present a method for post-training denoising user profiles using Large Language Models (LLMs) for Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendations. Our approach prompts LLMs with (i) a user profile (user interactions), (ii) a candidate item, and (iii) its rank as given by the CF recommender, and asks the LLM to remove items from the user profile to improve the rank of the candidate item. Experiments with a state-of-the-art CF recommender and 4 open and closed source LLMs in 3 datasets show that our denoising yields improvements up to 13% in effectiveness over the original user profiles.

Unleashing the Potential of Sparse Attention on Long-term Behaviors for CTR Prediction,"Weijiang Lai, Beihong Jin, Di Zhang, Siru Chen, Jiongyan Zhang, Yuhang Gou, Jian Dong, Xingxing Wang",2026-01-25,2601.17836v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17836v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.17836v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"In recent years, the success of large language models (LLMs) has driven the exploration of scaling laws in recommender systems. However, models that demonstrate scaling laws are actually challenging to deploy in industrial settings for modeling long sequences of user behaviors, due to the high computational complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism. Despite various sparse self-attention mechanisms proposed in other fields, they are not fully suited for recommendation scenarios. This is because user behaviors exhibit personalization and temporal characteristics: different users have distinct behavior patterns, and these patterns change over time, with data from these users differing significantly from data in other fields in terms of distribution. To address these challenges, we propose SparseCTR, an efficient and effective model specifically designed for long-term behaviors of users. To be precise, we first segment behavior sequences into chunks in a personalized manner to avoid separating continuous behaviors and enable parallel processing of sequences. Based on these chunks, we propose a three-branch sparse self-attention mechanism to jointly identify users' global interests, interest transitions, and short-term interests. Furthermore, we design a composite relative temporal encoding via learnable, head-specific bias coefficients, better capturing sequential and periodic relationships among user behaviors. Extensive experimental results show that SparseCTR not only improves efficiency but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, it exhibits an obvious scaling law phenomenon, maintaining performance improvements across three orders of magnitude in FLOPs. In online A/B testing, SparseCTR increased CTR by 1.72\% and CPM by 1.41\%. Our source code is available at https://github.com/laiweijiang/SparseCTR.",https://github.com/laiweijiang/SparseCTR,
Token-Weighted Multi-Target Learning for Generative Recommenders with Curriculum Learning,"Wei-Ning Chiu, Chuan-Ju Wang, Pu-Jen Cheng",2026-01-25,2601.17787v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17787v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.17787v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Generative recommender systems have recently attracted attention by formulating next-item prediction as an autoregressive sequence generation task. However, most existing methods optimize standard next-token likelihood and implicitly treat all tokens as equally informative, which is misaligned with semantic-ID-based generation. Accordingly, we propose two complementary information-gain-based token-weighting strategies tailored to generative recommendation with semantic IDs. Front-Greater Weighting captures conditional semantic information gain by prioritizing early tokens that most effectively reduce candidate-item uncertainty given their prefixes and encode coarse semantics. Frequency Weighting models marginal information gain under long-tailed item and token distributions, upweighting rare tokens to counteract popularity bias. Beyond individual strategies, we introduce a multi-target learning framework with curriculum learning that jointly optimizes the two token-weighted objectives alongside standard likelihood, enabling stable optimization and adaptive emphasis across training stages. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines and existing token-weighting approaches, with improved robustness, strong generalization across different semantic-ID constructions, and substantial gains on both head and tail items.

Existing LSR approaches have relied almost exclusively on uncased backbone models, whose vocabularies exclude case-sensitive distinctions, thereby reducing vocabulary mismatch. However, the most recent state-of-the-art language models are only available in cased versions. Despite this shift, the impact of backbone model casing on LSR has not been studied, potentially posing a risk to the viability of the method going forward. To fill this gap, we systematically evaluate paired cased and uncased versions of the same backbone models across multiple datasets to assess their suitability for LSR. Our findings show that LSR models with cased backbone models by default perform substantially worse than their uncased counterparts; however, this gap can be eliminated by pre-processing the text to lowercase. Moreover, our token-level analysis reveals that, under lowercasing, cased models almost entirely suppress cased vocabulary items and behave effectively as uncased models, explaining their restored performance. This result broadens the applicability of recent cased models to the LSR setting and facilitates the integration of stronger backbone architectures into sparse retrieval.

Towards Fair Large Language Model-based Recommender Systems without Costly Retraining,"Jin Li, Huilin Gu, Shoujin Wang, Qi Zhang, Shui Yu, Chen Wang, Xiwei Xu, Fang Chen",2026-01-24,2601.17492v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17492v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.17492v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Recommender Systems (RS) through advanced generative user modeling. However, LLM-based RS (LLM-RS) often inadvertently perpetuates bias present in the training data, leading to severe fairness issues. Addressing these fairness problems in LLM-RS faces two significant challenges. 1) Existing debiasing methods, designed for specific bias types, lack the generality to handle diverse or emerging biases in real-world applications. 2) Debiasing methods relying on retraining are computationally infeasible given the massive parameter scale of LLMs. To overcome these challenges, we propose FUDLR (Fast Unified Debiasing for LLM-RS). The core idea is to reformulate the debiasing problem as an efficient machine unlearning task with two stages. First, FUDLR identifies bias-inducing samples to unlearn through a novel bias-agnostic mask, optimized to balance fairness improvement with accuracy preservation. Its bias-agnostic design allows adaptability to various or co-existing biases simply by incorporating different fairness metrics. Second, FUDLR performs efficient debiasing by estimating and removing the influence of identified samples on model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUDLR effectively and efficiently improves fairness while preserving recommendation accuracy, offering a practical path toward socially responsible LLM-RS.

To overcome the limitations, this paper presents the Adversarial Alignment and Disentanglement Cross-Domain Recommendation ($A^2DCDR$ ) model, an innovative approach designed to capture a comprehensive range of cross-domain information, including both domain-invariant and valuable non-aligned features. The $A^2DCDR$ model enhances cross-domain recommendation through three key components: refining MMD with adversarial training for better generalization, employing a feature disentangler and reconstruction mechanism for intra-domain disentanglement, and introducing a novel fused representation combining domain-invariant, non-aligned features with original contextual data.

It typically involves two components: a tokenizer that learns item identifiers and a recommender trained on them. Existing methods often decouple tokenization from recommendation or rely on asynchronous alternating optimization, limiting full end-to-end alignment. To address this, we unify the tokenizer and recommender under the ultimate recommendation objective via differentiable soft item identifiers, enabling joint end-to-end training. However, this introduces three challenges: training-inference discrepancy due to soft-to-hard mismatch, item identifier collapse from codeword usage imbalance, and collaborative signal deficiency due to an overemphasis on fine-grained token-level semantics.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose UniGRec, a unified generative recommendation framework that addresses them from three perspectives. UniGRec employs Annealed Inference Alignment during tokenization to smoothly bridge soft training and hard inference, a Codeword Uniformity Regularization to prevent identifier collapse and encourage codebook diversity, and a Dual Collaborative Distillation mechanism that distills collaborative priors from a lightweight teacher model to jointly guide both the tokenizer and the recommender.

While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments.",https://github.com/Joinn99/MMGRid,https://github.com/Joinn99/MMGRid

We propose STAR (Semantic Table Representation), a lightweight framework that improves semantic table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion. STAR first applies header-aware K-means clustering to group semantically similar rows and selects representative centroid instances to construct a diverse partial table. It then generates cluster-specific synthetic queries to comprehensively cover the table's semantic space. Finally, STAR employs weighted fusion strategies to integrate table and query embeddings, enabling fine-grained semantic alignment. This design enables STAR to capture complementary information from structured and textual sources, improving the expressiveness of table representations.

We introduce CGPT, a training framework that enhances table retrieval through LLM-generated supervision. CGPT constructs semantically diverse partial tables by clustering table instances using K-means and sampling across clusters to broaden semantic coverage. An LLM then generates synthetic queries for these partial tables, which are used in hard-negative contrastive fine-tuning to refine the embedding model. Experiments across four public benchmarks (MimoTable, OTTQA, FetaQA, and E2E-WTQ) show that CGPT consistently outperforms retrieval baselines, including QGpT, with an average R@1 improvement of 16.54 percent. In a unified multi-domain corpus setting, CGPT further demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and remains effective even when using smaller LLMs for synthetic query generation.

However, the quality of guidance in the form of user information is often compromised by missing data in the observed sequences, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Existing methods address this by removing locally similar items, but overlook ``critical turning points'' in user interest, which are crucial for accurately predicting subsequent user intent. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Attention Regulation Diffusion model (CARD), which focuses on amplifying the signal from key interest-turning-point items while concurrently identifying and suppressing noise within the user sequence. CARD consists of (1) a Dual-side Thompson Sampling method to identify sequences undergoing significant interest shift, and (2) a counterfactual attention mechanism for these sequences to quantify the importance of each item. In this manner, CARD provides the diffusion model with a high-quality guidance signal composed of dynamically re-weighted interaction vectors to enable effective generation.

The generated SQL queries are executed natively by the database engine, while the task descriptions are consumed by downstream table learning frameworks. This design allows users to focus on modeling and analysis rather than low-level data preparation and pipeline orchestration. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TLSQL effectively lowers the barrier to integrating machine learning into databasecentric workflows.

Pervasive Annotation Errors Break Text-to-SQL Benchmarks and Leaderboards,"Tengjun Jin, Yoojin Choi, Yuxuan Zhu, Daniel Kang",2026-01-13,2601.08778v3,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08778v3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08778v3,databases,cs.AI,"Researchers have proposed numerous text-to-SQL techniques to streamline data analytics and accelerate the development of data-driven applications. To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial.
  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.

VISTA: Knowledge-Driven Interpretable Vessel Trajectory Imputation via Large Language Models,"Hengyu Liu, Tianyi Li, Haoyu Wang, Kristian Torp, Tiancheng Zhang, Yushuai Li, Christian S. Jensen",2026-01-11,2601.06940v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06940v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.06940v1,databases,cs.DB,"The Automatic Identification System provides critical information for maritime navigation and safety, yet its trajectories are often incomplete due to signal loss or deliberate tampering. Existing imputation methods emphasize trajectory recovery, paying limited attention to interpretability and failing to provide underlying knowledge that benefits downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and route planning. We propose knowledge-driven interpretable vessel trajectory imputation (VISTA), the first trajectory imputation framework that offers interpretability while simultaneously providing underlying knowledge to support downstream analysis. Specifically, we first define underlying knowledge as a combination of Structured Data-derived Knowledge (SDK) distilled from AIS data and Implicit LLM Knowledge acquired from large-scale Internet corpora. Second, to manage and leverage the SDK effectively at scale, we develop a data-knowledge-data loop that employs a Structured Data-derived Knowledge Graph for SDK extraction and knowledge-driven trajectory imputation. Third, to efficiently process large-scale AIS data, we introduce a workflow management layer that coordinates the end-to-end pipeline, enabling parallel knowledge extraction and trajectory imputation with anomaly handling and redundancy elimination. Experiments on two large AIS datasets show that VISTA is capable of state-of-the-art imputation accuracy and computational efficiency, improving over state-of-the-art baselines by 5%-94% and reducing time cost by 51%-93%, while producing interpretable knowledge cues that benefit downstream tasks.

Octopus: A Lightweight Entity-Aware System for Multi-Table Data Discovery and Cell-Level Retrieval,"Wen-Zhi Li, Sainyam Galhotra",2026-01-05,2601.02304v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02304v1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02304v1,databases,cs.DB,"Tabular data constitute a dominant form of information in modern data lakes and repositories, yet discovering the relevant tables to answer user questions remains challenging. Existing data discovery systems assume that each question can be answered by a single table and often rely on resource-intensive offline preprocessing, such as model training or large-scale content indexing. In practice, however, many questions require information spread across multiple tables -- either independently or through joins -- and users often seek specific cell values rather than entire tables. In this paper, we present Octopus, a lightweight, entity-aware, and training-free system for multi-table data discovery and cell-level value retrieval. Instead of embedding entire questions, Octopus identifies fine-grained entities (column mentions and value mentions) from natural-language queries using an LLM parser. It then matches these entities to table headers through a compact embedding index and scans table contents directly for value occurrences, eliminating the need for heavy content indexing or costly offline stages. The resulting fine-grained alignment not only improves table retrieval accuracy but also facilitates efficient downstream NL2SQL execution by reducing token usage and redundant LLM calls. To evaluate Octopus, we introduce a new benchmark covering both table- and cell-level discovery under multi-table settings, including five datasets for independent discovery and two for join-based discovery. Experimental results show that Octopus consistently outperforms existing systems while achieving substantially lower computational and token costs.

Accelerating Storage-Based Training for Graph Neural Networks,"Myung-Hwan Jang, Jeong-Min Park, Yunyong Ko, Sang-Wook Kim",2026-01-04,2601.01473v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01473v2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01473v2,databases,cs.LG,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved breakthroughs in various real-world downstream tasks due to their powerful expressiveness. As the scale of real-world graphs has been continuously growing, a storage-based approach to GNN training has been studied, which leverages external storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs) to handle such web-scale graphs on a single machine. Although such storage-based GNN training methods have shown promising potential in large-scale GNN training, we observed that they suffer from a severe bottleneck in data preparation since they overlook a critical challenge: how to handle a large number of small storage I/Os. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel storage-based GNN training framework, named AGNES, that employs a method of block-wise storage I/O processing to fully utilize the I/O bandwidth of high-performance storage devices. Moreover, to further enhance the efficiency of each storage I/O, AGNES employs a simple yet effective strategy, hyperbatch-based processing based on the characteristics of real-world graphs. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world graphs reveal that AGNES consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods, by up to 4.1X faster than the best competitor.
