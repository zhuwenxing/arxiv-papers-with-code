Hubness Reduction with Dual Bank Sinkhorn Normalization for Cross-Modal Retrieval,"Zhengxin Pan, Haishuai Wang, Fangyu Wu, Peng Zhang, Jiajun Bu",2025-08-04,2508.02538v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02538v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02538v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"The past decade has witnessed rapid advancements in cross-modal retrieval,
with significant progress made in accurately measuring the similarity between
cross-modal pairs. However, the persistent hubness problem, a phenomenon where
a small number of targets frequently appear as nearest neighbors to numerous
queries, continues to hinder the precision of similarity measurements. Despite
several proposed methods to reduce hubness, their underlying mechanisms remain
poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we analyze the widely-adopted Inverted
Softmax approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing target
probabilities during retrieval. Building on these insights, we propose a
probability-balancing framework for more effective hubness reduction. We
contend that balancing target probabilities alone is inadequate and, therefore,
extend the framework to balance both query and target probabilities by
introducing Sinkhorn Normalization (SN). Notably, we extend SN to scenarios
where the true query distribution is unknown, showing that current methods,
which rely solely on a query bank to estimate target hubness, produce
suboptimal results due to a significant distributional gap between the query
bank and targets. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Dual Bank Sinkhorn
Normalization (DBSN), incorporating a corresponding target bank alongside the
query bank to narrow this distributional gap. Our comprehensive evaluation
across various cross-modal retrieval tasks, including image-text retrieval,
video-text retrieval, and audio-text retrieval, demonstrates consistent
performance improvements, validating the effectiveness of both SN and DBSN. All

However, advanced RAG systems face a trade-off between performance and

excessive LLM calls and token costs, while Graph RAG methods suffer from
computationally expensive, error-prone graph construction and retrieval

T$^2$RAG leverages an LLM to decompose questions into searchable triplets with

the triplet database. Empirical results show that T$^2$RAG significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art multi-round and Graph RAG methods, achieving an

human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents

the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human

CM$^3$: Calibrating Multimodal Recommendation,"Xin Zhou, Yongjie Wang, Zhiqi Shen",2025-08-02,2508.01226v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01226v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01226v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Alignment and uniformity are fundamental principles within the domain of
contrastive learning. In recommender systems, prior work has established that
optimizing the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss contributes to the
objectives of alignment and uniformity. Specifically, alignment aims to draw
together the representations of interacting users and items, while uniformity
mandates a uniform distribution of user and item embeddings across a unit
hypersphere. This study revisits the alignment and uniformity properties within
the context of multimodal recommender systems, revealing a proclivity among
extant models to prioritize uniformity to the detriment of alignment. Our
hypothesis challenges the conventional assumption of equitable item treatment
through a uniformity loss, proposing a more nuanced approach wherein items with
similar multimodal attributes converge toward proximal representations within
the hyperspheric manifold. Specifically, we leverage the inherent similarity
between items' multimodal data to calibrate their uniformity distribution,
thereby inducing a more pronounced repulsive force between dissimilar entities
within the embedding space. A theoretical analysis elucidates the relationship
between this calibrated uniformity loss and the conventional uniformity
function. Moreover, to enhance the fusion of multimodal features, we introduce
a Spherical B\'ezier method designed to integrate an arbitrary number of
modalities while ensuring that the resulting fused features are constrained to
the same hyperspherical manifold. Empirical evaluations conducted on five
real-world datasets substantiate the superiority of our approach over competing
baselines. We also shown that the proposed methods can achieve up to a 5.4%
increase in NDCG@20 performance via the integration of MLLM-extracted features.

become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination
issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing
single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address
different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world
queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost
efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent
orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.
Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG
modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and
generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the
appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for
each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable
costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement
learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based
penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a
reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate
that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only
achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within
acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on

abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural
language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by
a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts
self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into

history. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that
integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel

promising performance compared to traditional models. A key factor contributing

performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,
where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,
where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently
improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can

StructText: A Synthetic Table-to-Text Approach for Benchmark Generation with Multi-Dimensional Evaluation,"Satyananda Kashyap, Sola Shirai, Nandana Mihindukulasooriya, Horst Samulowitz",2025-07-28,2507.21340v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21340v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21340v1,databases,cs.CL,"Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.",https://github.com/ibm/struct-text,"Data available:

MH-GIN: Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based Imputation Network for AIS Data (Extended Version),"Hengyu Liu, Tianyi Li, Yuqiang He, Kristian Torp, Yushuai Li, Christian S. Jensen",2025-07-27,2507.20362v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20362v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20362v1,databases,cs.LG,"Location-tracking data from the Automatic Identification System, much of
which is publicly available, plays a key role in a range of maritime safety and
monitoring applications. However, the data suffers from missing values that
hamper downstream applications. Imputing the missing values is challenging
because the values of different heterogeneous attributes are updated at diverse
rates, resulting in the occurrence of multi-scale dependencies among
attributes. Existing imputation methods that assume similar update rates across
attributes are unable to capture and exploit such dependencies, limiting their
imputation accuracy. We propose MH-GIN, a Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based
Imputation Network that aims improve imputation accuracy by capturing
multi-scale dependencies. Specifically, MH-GIN first extracts multi-scale
temporal features for each attribute while preserving their intrinsic
heterogeneous characteristics. Then, it constructs a multi-scale heterogeneous
graph to explicitly model dependencies between heterogeneous attributes to
enable more accurate imputation of missing values through graph propagation.
Experimental results on two real-world datasets find that MH-GIN is capable of
an average 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code and
implementation details of MH-GIN are publicly available

Graph-Structured Data Analysis of Component Failure in Autonomous Cargo Ships Based on Feature Fusion,"Zizhao Zhang, Tianxiang Zhao, Yu Sun, Liping Sun, Jichuan Kang",2025-07-18,2507.13721v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13721v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13721v1,databases,cs.LG,"To address the challenges posed by cascading reactions caused by component
failures in autonomous cargo ships (ACS) and the uncertainties in emergency
decision-making, this paper proposes a novel hybrid feature fusion framework
for constructing a graph-structured dataset of failure modes. By employing an
improved cuckoo search algorithm (HN-CSA), the literature retrieval efficiency
is significantly enhanced, achieving improvements of 7.1% and 3.4% compared to
the NSGA-II and CSA search algorithms, respectively. A hierarchical feature
fusion framework is constructed, using Word2Vec encoding to encode
subsystem/component features, BERT-KPCA to process failure modes/reasons, and
Sentence-BERT to quantify the semantic association between failure impact and
emergency decision-making. The dataset covers 12 systems, 1,262 failure modes,
and 6,150 propagation paths. Validation results show that the GATE-GNN model
achieves a classification accuracy of 0.735, comparable to existing benchmarks.
Additionally, a silhouette coefficient of 0.641 indicates that the features are
highly distinguishable. In the label prediction results, the Shore-based
Meteorological Service System achieved an F1 score of 0.93, demonstrating high
prediction accuracy. This paper not only provides a solid foundation for
failure analysis in autonomous cargo ships but also offers reliable support for
fault diagnosis, risk assessment, and intelligent decision-making systems. The

TOPJoin: A Context-Aware Multi-Criteria Approach for Joinable Column Search,"Harsha Kokel, Aamod Khatiwada, Tejaswini Pedapati, Haritha Ananthakrishnan, Oktie Hassanzadeh, Horst Samulowitz, Kavitha Srinivas",2025-07-15,2507.11505v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11505v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11505v1,databases,cs.DB,"One of the major challenges in enterprise data analysis is the task of
finding joinable tables that are conceptually related and provide meaningful
insights. Traditionally, joinable tables have been discovered through a search
for similar columns, where two columns are considered similar syntactically if
there is a set overlap or they are considered similar semantically if either
the column embeddings or value embeddings are closer in the embedding space.
However, for enterprise data lakes, column similarity is not sufficient to
identify joinable columns and tables. The context of the query column is
important. Hence, in this work, we first define context-aware column
joinability. Then we propose a multi-criteria approach, called TOPJoin, for
joinable column search. We evaluate TOPJoin against existing join search
baselines over one academic and one real-world join search benchmark. Through
experiments, we find that TOPJoin performs better on both benchmarks than the
baselines.",https://github.com/IBM/ContextAwareJoin,"VLDB 2025 Workshop: Tabular Data Analysis (TaDA); The source code,
