    "abstract": "Reproducing and comparing results in news recommendation research has become\nincreasingly difficult. This is due to a fragmented ecosystem of diverse\ncodebases, varied configurations, and mainly due to resource-intensive models.\nWe introduce NewsReX, an open-source library designed to streamline this\nprocess. Our key contribution is a modern implementation built on Keras 3 and\nJAX, which provides an increase in computational efficiency. Experiments show\nthat NewsReX is faster than current implementations. To support broader\nresearch, we provide a straightforward guide and scripts for training models on\ncustom datasets. We validated this functionality using a proprietary Japanese\nnews dataset from Nikkei News, a leading Japanese media corporation renowned\nfor its comprehensive coverage of business, economic, and financial news.\nNewsReX makes reproducing complex experiments faster and more accessible to a\nwider range of hardware making sure the speed up it also achieved for less\npowerful GPUs, like an 8GB RTX 3060 Ti. Beyond the library, this paper offers\nan analysis of key training parameters often overlooked in the literature,\nincluding the effect of different negative sampling strategies, the varying\nnumber of epochs, the impact of random batching, and more. This supplementary\nanalysis serves as a valuable reference for future research, aiming to reduce\nredundant computation when comparing baselines and guide best practices.

    "abstract": "In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to\nmodel users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods\nare mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to\ncomprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing\nto directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate\nprediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle\ncommonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to\nconsider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex\ninteractions between modalities.\n  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based\nMulti-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through\nprediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal\nFeature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,\nand the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC\nModule extract synergistic, common, and special information among different\nmodalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,\nimproving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among\ndifferent features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the\nFDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive\nexperiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results\ndemonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least\n1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing\nmulti-modal recommendation systems.

To\nautomate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,\nmethods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured\nones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like\nNL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of\nsemi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To\nthis end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured\ntable question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the\nHierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures\ncomplex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for\nconstructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to\nguide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor\ndecomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree\noperation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate\npipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:\nforward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward\nvalidation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from\npredicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of\n764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to\nsimulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain\nalignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale\nsimulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is\nthe extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such\nfeedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is\noften ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference\nalignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the\nefficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering\nmechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we\nintroduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in\nRSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data.\nOur framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate\ncognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing\nambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty\nestimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation\nsamples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using\nsuch high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes.\nExtensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the\nalignment with human preferences and in-domain reasoning capabilities of\nfine-tuned LLMs, and provides more insightful and interpretable signals when\ninteracting with RSs.

Although multi-task learning is widely adopted to jointly optimize\nDT and CTR, we observe that multi-task models systematically collapse their DT\npredictions to the shortest and longest bins, under-predicting the moderate\ndurations. We attribute this moderate-duration bin under-representation to\nover-reliance on the CTR-DT spurious correlation, and propose ORCA to address\nit with causal-decoupling. Specifically, ORCA explicitly models and subtracts\nCTR's negative transfer while preserving its positive transfer. We further\nintroduce (i) feature-level counterfactual intervention, and (ii) a\ntask-interaction module with instance inverse-weighting, weakening CTR-mediated\neffect and restoring direct DT semantics. ORCA is model-agnostic and easy to\ndeploy. Experiments show an average 10.6% lift in DT metrics without harming\nCTR.

    "abstract": "Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,\nfinancial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve\nflexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).\nThese tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and\nanswer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To\nautomate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,\nmethods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured\nones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like\nNL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of\nsemi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To\nthis end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured\ntable question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the\nHierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures\ncomplex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for\nconstructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to\nguide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor\ndecomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree\noperation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate\npipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:\nforward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward\nvalidation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from\npredicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of\n764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables.

    "abstract": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a crucial role in many key\nareas. Proximity graphs (PGs) are the leading method for ANNS, offering the\nbest balance between query efficiency and accuracy. However, their performance\nheavily depends on various construction and query parameters, which are\ndifficult to optimize due to their complex inter-dependencies. Given that users\noften prioritize specific accuracy levels, efficiently identifying the optimal\nPG configurations to meet these targets is essential. Although some studies\nhave explored automatic configuration tuning for PGs, they are limited by\ninefficiencies and suboptimal results. These issues stem from the need to\nconstruct numerous PGs for searching and re-tuning from scratch whenever the\ndataset changes, as well as the failure to capture the complex dependencies\nbetween configurations, query performance, and tuning objectives.\n  To address these challenges, we propose PGTuner, an efficient framework for\nautomatic PG configuration tuning leveraging pre-training knowledge and model\ntransfer techniques. PGTuner improves efficiency through a pre-trained query\nperformance prediction (QPP) model, eliminating the need to build multiple PGs.\nIt also features a deep reinforcement learning-based parameter configuration\nrecommendation (PCR) model to recommend optimal configurations for specific\ndatasets and accuracy targets. Additionally, PGTuner incorporates\nout-of-distribution detection and deep active learning for efficient tuning in\ndynamic scenarios and transferring to new datasets. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that PGTuner can stably achieve the top-level tuning effect across\ndifferent datasets while significantly improving tuning efficiency by up to\n14.69X, with a 14.64X boost in dynamic scenarios.

    "abstract": "Web proxies such as NGINX commonly rely on least-recently-used (LRU)\neviction, which is size agnostic and can thrash under periodic bursts and mixed\nobject sizes. We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that\nreplaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an\nONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL\nsamples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features\n(age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT),\nand requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers\nimmediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying\nNGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained\nobject earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against\nLRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial\nworkloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538,\na 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from\n0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods\n(about 0.918). Inference adds less than 2 percent CPU overhead and keeps 95th\npercentile eviction latency within budget.

However, despite the widespread use of RDBs\nacross various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders\ntheir ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous\nresearch has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among\nmultiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key\nrelationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or\nconstructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations\namong different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for\npredictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified\npredictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary\ndependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,\nand propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns\nfor prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism\ninto RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite\ndependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive\nfield of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive\nanalysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model\nbehaviors and practical guidelines for future applications.
