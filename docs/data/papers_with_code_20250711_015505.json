    "abstract": "LLM-based recommender systems have made significant progress; however, the\ndeployment cost associated with the large parameter volume of LLMs still\nhinders their real-world applications. This work explores parameter pruning to\nimprove parameter efficiency while maintaining recommendation quality, thereby\nenabling easier deployment. Unlike existing approaches that focus primarily on\ninter-layer redundancy, we uncover intra-layer redundancy within components\nsuch as self-attention and MLP modules. Building on this analysis, we propose a\nmore fine-grained pruning approach that integrates both intra-layer and\nlayer-wise pruning. Specifically, we introduce a three-stage pruning strategy\nthat progressively prunes parameters at different levels and parts of the\nmodel, moving from intra-layer to layer-wise pruning, or from width to depth.\nEach stage also includes a performance restoration step using distillation\ntechniques, helping to strike a balance between performance and parameter\nefficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach:\nacross three datasets, our models achieve an average of 88% of the original\nmodel's performance while pruning more than 95% of the non-embedding\nparameters. This underscores the potential of our method to significantly\nreduce resource requirements without greatly compromising recommendation\nquality.

However, as platforms expand to dozens\nor hundreds of scenarios, training all domains in a unified model leads to\nperformance degradation due to significant inter-domain differences. Existing\ndomain grouping methods, based on business logic or data similarities, often\nfail to capture the true transfer relationships required for optimal grouping.\nTo effectively cluster domains, we propose Causal Domain Clustering (CDC). CDC\nmodels domain transfer patterns within a large number of domains using two\ndistinct effects: the Isolated Domain Affinity Matrix for modeling\nnon-interactive domain transfers, and the Hybrid Domain Affinity Matrix for\nconsidering dynamic domain synergy or interference under joint training. To\nintegrate these two transfer effects, we introduce causal discovery to\ncalculate a cohesion-based coefficient that adaptively balances their\ncontributions. A Co-Optimized Dynamic Clustering algorithm iteratively\noptimizes target domain clustering and source domain selection for training.\nCDC significantly enhances performance across over 50 domains on public\ndatasets and in industrial settings, achieving a 4.9% increase in online eCPM.\nCode is available at\nhttps://github.com/Chrissie-Law/Causal-Domain-Clustering-for-Multi-Domain-Recommendation",

While dense retrieval methods have substantially improved semantic\nmatching for general queries, they consistently underperform on queries with\nexplicit temporal constraints--often those containing numerical expressions and\ntime specifiers such as ``in 2015.'' Existing approaches to Temporal\nInformation Retrieval (TIR) improve temporal reasoning but often suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced performance on non-temporal\nqueries.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models, known for their generative ability to simulate data\ncreation through noise-adding and denoising processes, have emerged as a\npromising approach for building generative recommenders. To incorporate user\nhistory for personalization, existing methods typically adopt a conditional\ndiffusion framework, where the reverse denoising process of reconstructing\nitems from noise is modified to be conditioned on the user history. However,\nthis design may fail to fully utilize historical information, as it gets\ndistracted by the need to model the \"item $\\leftrightarrow$ noise\" translation.\nThis motivates us to reformulate the diffusion process for sequential\nrecommendation in an unconditional manner, treating user history (instead of\nnoise) as the endpoint of the forward diffusion process (i.e., the starting\npoint of the reverse process), rather than as a conditional input. This\nformulation allows for exclusive focus on modeling the \"item $\\leftrightarrow$\nhistory\" translation. To this end, we introduce Brownian Bridge Diffusion\nRecommendation (BBDRec). By leveraging a Brownian bridge process, BBDRec\nenforces a structured noise addition and denoising mechanism, ensuring that the\ntrajectories are constrained towards a specific endpoint -- user history,\nrather than noise.

Therefore, this paper systematically deconstruct the pros and\ncons of ID features: (i) they provide initial embedding but lack semantic\nrichness, (ii) they provide a unique identifier for each user and item but\nhinder generalization to untrained data, and (iii) they assist in aligning and\nfusing multimodal features but may lead to representation shift.

IDFREE replaces ID features with multimodal\nfeatures and positional encodings to generate semantically meaningful ID-free\nembeddings. For ID-free multimodal collaborative filtering, it further proposes\nan adaptive similarity graph module to construct dynamic user-user and\nitem-item graphs based on multimodal features.

Conversely, pairwise comparisons are\nparticularly effective for identifying strong contenders among models with\nlower global scores, especially where quality metrics are hard to define (e.g.,\ntext generation), though they require more comparisons to converge if ties are\nfrequent.

    "abstract": "Table structure recognition (TSR) and optical character recognition (OCR)\nplay crucial roles in extracting structured data from tables in scientific\ndocuments. However, existing extraction frameworks built on top of TSR and OCR\nmethods often fail to quantify the uncertainties of extracted results. To\nobtain highly accurate data for scientific domains, all extracted data must be\nmanually verified, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. We propose\na framework that performs uncertainty-aware data extraction for complex\nscientific tables, built on conformal prediction, a model-agnostic method for\nuncertainty quantification (UQ). We explored various uncertainty scoring\nmethods to aggregate the uncertainties introduced by TSR and OCR. We rigorously\nevaluated the framework using a standard benchmark and an in-house dataset\nconsisting of complex scientific tables in six scientific domains. The results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of using UQ for extraction error detection, and\nby manually verifying only 47% of extraction results, the data quality can be\nimproved by 30%. Our work quantitatively demonstrates the role of UQ with the\npotential of improving the efficiency in the human-machine cooperation process\nto obtain scientifically usable data from complex tables in scientific\ndocuments.

    "abstract": "Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often\nresulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on\nattributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches\nhave started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,\nthe issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant\nproblems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address\nthese challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive\nMulti-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),\naiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive\nConversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide\nrange of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive\nlearning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate\ninformative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic\nuser-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that\nHyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively\nalleviating unfairness.

    "abstract": "Tool retrieval is a critical component in enabling large language models\n(LLMs) to interact effectively with external tools. It aims to precisely filter\nthe massive tools into a small set of candidates for the downstream\ntool-augmented LLMs. However, most existing approaches primarily focus on\noptimizing tool representations, often neglecting the importance of precise\nquery comprehension. To address this gap, we introduce MassTool, a multi-task\nsearch-based framework designed to enhance both query representation and tool\nretrieval accuracy. MassTool employs a two-tower architecture: a tool usage\ndetection tower that predicts the need for function calls, and a tool retrieval\ntower that leverages a query-centric graph convolution network (QC-GCN) for\neffective query-tool matching. It also incorporates search-based user intent\nmodeling (SUIM) to handle diverse and out-of-distribution queries, alongside an\nadaptive knowledge transfer (AdaKT) module for efficient multi-task learning.\nBy jointly optimizing tool usage detection loss, list-wise retrieval loss, and\ncontrastive regularization loss, MassTool establishes a robust dual-step\nsequential decision-making pipeline for precise query understanding. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval accuracy. Our\ncode is available at https://github.com/wxydada/MassTool.",

    "abstract": "Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately\npredict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on\nthe given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking\nmodels employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth\nschema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation\narises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample\nfor downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema\nlinking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1\nconsists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality\nreasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and\nrule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that\nour method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking\nmodel, achieving a 10\\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing\nmethod.
