    "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored for integration\nwith collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommendation systems, which are\ncrucial for personalizing user experiences. However, a key challenge is that\nLLMs struggle to interpret the latent, non-semantic embeddings produced by CF\napproaches, limiting recommendation effectiveness and further applications. To\naddress this, we propose FACE, a general interpretable framework that maps CF\nembeddings into pre-trained LLM tokens. Specifically, we introduce a\ndisentangled projection module to decompose CF embeddings into concept-specific\nvectors, followed by a quantized autoencoder to convert continuous embeddings\ninto LLM tokens (descriptors). Then, we design a contrastive alignment\nobjective to ensure that the tokens align with corresponding textual signals.\nHence, the model-agnostic FACE framework achieves semantic alignment without\nfine-tuning LLMs and enhances recommendation performance by leveraging their\npre-trained capabilities. Empirical results on three real-world recommendation\ndatasets demonstrate performance improvements in benchmark models, with\ninterpretability studies confirming the interpretability of the descriptors.\nCode is available in https://github.com/YixinRoll/FACE.",

A key challenge with these neural Transformer-based models is\nthat they often struggle to generalize beyond the specific tasks and domains\nthey were trained on. To address this challenge, prior research in IR\nincorporated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within each Transformer\nlayer of a DRM, which, though effective, substantially increased the number of\nadditional parameters. In this paper, we propose a more efficient design, which\nintroduces a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the final Transformer layer. To\nassess the retrieval effectiveness of SB-MoE, we perform an empirical\nevaluation across three IR tasks. Our experiments involve two evaluation\nsetups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot\ngeneralizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different\nunderlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective\ntest sets. In the second setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE on MSMARCO and perform\nzero-shot evaluation on thirteen BEIR datasets. Additionally, we perform\nfurther experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters\n(i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this\nvariation affects SB-MoE's performance. The obtained results show that SB-MoE\nis particularly effective for DRMs with lightweight base models, such as\nTinyBERT and BERT-Small, consistently exceeding standard model fine-tuning\nacross benchmarks. For DRMs with more parameters, such as BERT-Base and\nContriever, our model requires a larger number of training samples to achieve\nimproved retrieval performance.

However, their performance remains constrained by\nlimited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as\ncontext to augment reasoning.

To overcome these limitations, we propose\n\\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into\nstructured representations optimized for reasoning.

Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our\napproach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific\nstructures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and\nreliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural\nverification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both\ncorrect and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive\nbenchmarks show that \\textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive\nperformance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much\nlarger models.

Moreover, no algorithms have yet been developed specifically for\nmining low-utility sequential patterns. To address these problems, we formalize\nthe LUSPM problem, redefine sequence utility, and introduce a compact data\nstructure called the sequence-utility chain to efficiently record utility\ninformation. Furthermore, we propose three novel algorithm--LUSPM_b, LUSPM_s,\nand LUSPM_e--to discover the complete set of low-utility sequential patterns.\nLUSPM_b serves as an exhaustive baseline, while LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e build upon\nit, generating subsequences through shrinkage and extension operations,\nrespectively. In addition, we introduce the maximal non-mutually contained\nsequence set and incorporate multiple pruning strategies, which significantly\nreduce redundant operations in both LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e. Finally, extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that both LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e substantially\noutperform LUSPM_b and exhibit excellent scalability. Notably, LUSPM_e achieves\nsuperior efficiency, requiring less runtime and memory consumption than\nLUSPM_s. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zhidong-Lin/LUSPM.",

To address these challenges, we\npropose Knowledge Graph-guided Multi-Agent System Distillation (KG-MASD). Our\napproach formulates distillation as a Markov Decision Process and incorporates\na knowledge graph as a verifiable structured prior to enrich state\nrepresentation and ensure convergence. By integrating collaborative reasoning\nwith knowledge grounding, KG-MASD generates high-confidence instruction-tuning\ndata and jointly distills reasoning depth and verifiability into compact\nstudent models suitable for edge deployment. Experiments on an industrial QA\ndataset show that KG-MASD improves accuracy by 2.4 per cent to 20.1 per cent\nover baselines and significantly enhances reliability, enabling trustworthy AI\ndeployment in safety-critical industrial scenarios.

These manual efforts limit scalability,\nreproducibility, and cross-institutional generalization. To address this, we\nintroduce EMR-AGENT (Automated Generalized Extraction and Navigation Tool), an\nagent-based framework that replaces manual rule writing with dynamic, language\nmodel-driven interaction to extract and standardize structured clinical data.\nOur framework automates cohort selection, feature extraction, and code mapping\nthrough interactive querying of databases. Our modular agents iteratively\nobserve query results and reason over schema and documentation, using SQL not\njust for data retrieval but also as a tool for database observation and\ndecision making. This eliminates the need for hand-crafted, schema-specific\nlogic. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop a benchmarking codebase for\nthree EMR databases (MIMIC-III, eICU, SICdb), including both seen and unseen\nschema settings. Our results demonstrate strong performance and generalization\nacross these databases, highlighting the feasibility of automating a process\npreviously thought to require expert-driven design.

    "abstract": "Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,\nwhere metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)\nare commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be\nNP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity\nscore in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they\neither involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively\nutilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we\npropose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region\n(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency\npatterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node\nfeatures and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,\ngraph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and\nthe volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph\nregions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions\nand adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED\nand propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis\nenables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global\nstructural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive\nperformance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\\%\nrelative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity\nlearning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.\nMoreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED\nsimilarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph\nsimilarity.

    "abstract": "Pharmacokinetics (PK) plays a critical role in drug development and\nregulatory decision-making for human and veterinary medicine, directly\naffecting public health through drug safety and efficacy assessments. However,\nPK data are often embedded in complex, heterogeneous tables with variable\nstructures and inconsistent terminologies, posing significant challenges for\nautomated PK data retrieval and standardization. AutoPK, a novel two-stage\nframework for accurate and scalable extraction of PK data from complex\nscientific tables. In the first stage, AutoPK identifies and extracts PK\nparameter variants using large language models (LLMs), a hybrid similarity\nmetric, and LLM-based validation. The second stage filters relevant rows,\nconverts the table into a key-value text format, and uses an LLM to reconstruct\na standardized table. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of 605 PK tables,\nincluding captions and footnotes, AutoPK shows significant improvements in\nprecision and recall over direct LLM baselines. For instance, AutoPK with LLaMA\n3.1-70B achieved an F1-score of 0.92 on half-life and 0.91 on clearance\nparameters, outperforming direct use of LLaMA 3.1-70B by margins of 0.10 and\n0.21, respectively. Smaller models such as Gemma 3-27B and Phi 3-12B with\nAutoPK achieved 2-7 fold F1 gains over their direct use, with Gemma's\nhallucination rates reduced from 60-95% down to 8-14%. Notably, AutoPK enabled\nopen-source models like Gemma 3-27B to outperform commercial systems such as\nGPT-4o Mini on several PK parameters. AutoPK enables scalable and\nhigh-confidence PK data extraction, making it well-suited for critical\napplications in veterinary pharmacology, drug safety monitoring, and public\nhealth decision-making, while addressing heterogeneous table structures and\nterminology and demonstrating generalizability across key PK parameters.
