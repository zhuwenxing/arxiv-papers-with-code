InPars+: Supercharging Synthetic Data Generation for Information Retrieval Systems,"Matey Krastev, Miklos Hamar, Danilo Toapanta, Jesse Brouwers, Yibin Lei",2025-08-19,2508.13930v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13930v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13930v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"This work revisits and extends synthetic query generation pipelines for
Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) by leveraging the InPars Toolkit, a
reproducible, end-to-end framework for generating training data using large
language models (LLMs). We first assess the reproducibility of the original
InPars, InPars-V2, and Promptagator pipelines on the SciFact benchmark and
validate their effectiveness using open-source reranker and generator models.
Building on this foundation, we introduce two key extensions to the pipeline:
(1) fine-tuning a query generator LLM via Contrastive Preference Optimization
(CPO) to improve the signal quality in generated queries, and (2) replacing
static prompt templates with dynamic, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) optimized prompts
using the DSPy framework. Our results show that both extensions reduce the need
for aggressive filtering while improving retrieval performance. All code,

they optimize for specific tasks with fixed modality pairings, and lack
comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating unified retrieval approaches. To
address these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce
search framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and
their combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a
flexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive
fusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations
while handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training
strategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),
cohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and
adaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated
multimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search
evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently
outperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning
or zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial
improvements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image
retrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to
larger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy
UniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search

Refining Contrastive Learning and Homography Relations for Multi-Modal Recommendation,"Shouxing Ma, Yawen Zeng, Shiqing Wu, Guandong Xu",2025-08-19,2508.13745v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13745v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13745v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Multi-modal recommender system focuses on utilizing rich modal information (
i.e., images and textual descriptions) of items to improve recommendation
performance. The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the
powerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these

contrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to
address the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main
limitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective
representations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable
information in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the
homograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in
incomplete mining of user-item interplay.
  To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for

multi-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal

retain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine
homogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user
interest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user
co-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive

act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering
information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on
modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on
identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However,
existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods
fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to
account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two
models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to
unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM
fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving
interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces
a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM
incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank

LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous
knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase

an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling

coarse-grained skewness induced by a significant concentration of quick-skips1,
(2) fine-grained diversity arising from various user-video interaction

preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and

accelerate training and inference, we investigated the recent generative
recommendation models HSTU and FuXi-$\alpha$, identifying two efficiency
bottlenecks: the indexing operations in relative temporal attention bias and
the computation of the query-key attention map. Additionally, we observed that
relative attention bias in self-attention mechanisms can also serve as
attention maps. Previous works like Synthesizer have shown that alternative
forms of attention maps can achieve similar performance, naturally raising the
question of whether some attention maps are redundant. Through empirical
experiments, we discovered that using the query-key attention map might degrade
the model's performance in recommendation tasks. To address these bottlenecks,
we propose a new framework applicable to Transformer-like recommendation
models. On one hand, we introduce Functional Relative Attention Bias, which
avoids the time-consuming operations of the original relative attention bias,
thereby accelerating the process. On the other hand, we remove the query-key
attention map from the original self-attention layer and design a new

workloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538,
a 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from
0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods
(about 0.918). Inference adds less than 2 percent CPU overhead and keeps 95th
percentile eviction latency within budget. To our knowledge, this is the first

"Synthesize, Retrieve, and Propagate: A Unified Predictive Modeling Framework for Relational Databases","Ning Li, Kounianhua Du, Han Zhang, Quan Gan, Minjie Wang, David Wipf, Weinan Zhang",2025-08-10,2508.08327v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08327v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08327v1,databases,cs.DB,"Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing
massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released

CRINN: Contrastive Reinforcement Learning for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search,"Xiaoya Li, Xiaofei Sun, Albert Wang, Chris Shum, Jiwei Li",2025-08-04,2508.02091v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02091v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02091v2,databases,cs.LG,"Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become
increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement. Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN",https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN,Preprint Version
DBAIOps: A Reasoning LLM-Enhanced Database Operation and Maintenance System using Knowledge Graphs,"Wei Zhou, Peng Sun, Xuanhe Zhou, Qianglei Zang, Ji Xu, Tieying Zhang, Guoliang Li, Fan Wu",2025-08-02,2508.01136v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01136v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01136v1,databases,cs.DB,"The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to
ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert
experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective
diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods,
including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On
the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,
metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and
cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting
guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve
fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate
inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present
DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with
knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a
heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and
proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from
thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)
reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and
implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps
proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis
paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a
reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear
diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four
mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates
that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher
in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.",https://github.com/weAIDB/DBAIOps,"DBAIOps supports 25 database systems and has been deployed in 20

StructText: A Synthetic Table-to-Text Approach for Benchmark Generation with Multi-Dimensional Evaluation,"Satyananda Kashyap, Sola Shirai, Nandana Mihindukulasooriya, Horst Samulowitz",2025-07-28,2507.21340v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21340v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21340v1,databases,cs.CL,"Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.",https://github.com/ibm/struct-text,"Data available:
