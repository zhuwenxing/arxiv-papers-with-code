    "abstract": "Modern recommendation systems face significant challenges in processing\nmultimodal sequential data, particularly in temporal dynamics modeling and\ninformation flow coordination. Traditional approaches struggle with\ndistribution discrepancies between heterogeneous features and noise\ninterference in multimodal signals. We propose \\textbf{FindRec}~\n(\\textbf{F}lexible unified \\textbf{in}formation \\textbf{d}isentanglement for\nmulti-modal sequential \\textbf{Rec}ommendation), introducing a novel\n\"information flow-control-output\" paradigm. The framework features two key\ninnovations: (1) A Stein kernel-based Integrated Information Coordination\nModule (IICM) that theoretically guarantees distribution consistency between\nmultimodal features and ID streams, and (2) A cross-modal expert routing\nmechanism that adaptively filters and combines multimodal features based on\ntheir contextual relevance. Our approach leverages multi-head subspace\ndecomposition for routing stability and RBF-Stein gradient for unbiased\ndistribution alignment, enhanced by linear-complexity Mamba layers for\nefficient temporal modeling. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate FindRec's superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines,\nparticularly in handling long sequences and noisy multimodal inputs. Our\nframework achieves both improved recommendation accuracy and enhanced model\ninterpretability through its modular design.

Existing SBR models often focus only on single-session information,\nignoring inter-session relationships and valuable cross-session insights.

Additionally, most models rely on\nitem ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their\nability to capture fine-grained item features. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel hierarchical intent-guided optimization approach with pluggable\nLLM-driven semantic learning for session-based recommendations, called HIPHOP.\nFirst, we introduce a pluggable embedding module based on large language models\n(LLMs) to generate high-quality semantic representations, enhancing item\nembeddings. Second, HIPHOP utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item\ntransition relationships and incorporates a dynamic multi-intent capturing\nmodule to address users' diverse interests within a session. Additionally, we\ndesign a hierarchical inter-session similarity learning module, guided by user\nintent, to capture global and local session relationships, effectively\nexploring users' long-term and short-term interests. To mitigate noise, an\nintent-guided denoising strategy is applied during inter-session learning.\nFinally, we enhance the model's discriminative capability by using contrastive\nlearning to optimize session representations.

In this paper, we\nintroduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from\nspecialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into\nfocused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with\nexternal tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through\na structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details\nfrom disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage\nspecialized expertise for different types of information processing.\nExperiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate\nthat HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based\nsystems.

Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference\nalignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we\npropose LPO4Rec, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison\nto listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training.\nSpecifically, we derive a closed form optimal policy to enable more efficient\nand effective training without explicit reward modeling.

Through computational experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets using standard global metrics and the popular Bradley-Terry\nmodel for pairwise comparisons, we found that while global scores provide more\nreliable overall rankings, they can underestimate strong models with rare,\nsignificant errors or low confidence. Conversely, pairwise comparisons are\nparticularly effective for identifying strong contenders among models with\nlower global scores, especially where quality metrics are hard to define (e.g.,\ntext generation), though they require more comparisons to converge if ties are\nfrequent.
