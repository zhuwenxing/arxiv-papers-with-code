FindRec: Stein-Guided Entropic Flow for Multi-Modal Sequential Recommendation,"Maolin Wang, Yutian Xiao, Binhao Wang, Sheng Zhang, Shanshan Ye, Wanyu Wang, Hongzhi Yin, Ruocheng Guo, Zenglin Xu",2025-07-07,2507.04651v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04651v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04651v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Modern recommendation systems face significant challenges in processing
multimodal sequential data, particularly in temporal dynamics modeling and
information flow coordination. Traditional approaches struggle with
distribution discrepancies between heterogeneous features and noise
interference in multimodal signals. We propose \textbf{FindRec}~
(\textbf{F}lexible unified \textbf{in}formation \textbf{d}isentanglement for
multi-modal sequential \textbf{Rec}ommendation), introducing a novel
""information flow-control-output"" paradigm. The framework features two key
innovations: (1) A Stein kernel-based Integrated Information Coordination
Module (IICM) that theoretically guarantees distribution consistency between
multimodal features and ID streams, and (2) A cross-modal expert routing
mechanism that adaptively filters and combines multimodal features based on
their contextual relevance. Our approach leverages multi-head subspace
decomposition for routing stability and RBF-Stein gradient for unbiased
distribution alignment, enhanced by linear-complexity Mamba layers for
efficient temporal modeling. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets
demonstrate FindRec's superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines,
particularly in handling long sequences and noisy multimodal inputs. Our
framework achieves both improved recommendation accuracy and enhanced model
interpretability through its modular design. The implementation code is

Hierarchical Intent-guided Optimization with Pluggable LLM-Driven Semantics for Session-based Recommendation,"Jinpeng Chen, Jianxiang He, Huan Li, Senzhang Wang, Yuan Cao, Kaimin Wei, Zhenye Yang, Ye Ji",2025-07-07,2507.04623v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04623v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04623v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Session-based Recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item a user will
likely engage with, using their interaction sequence within an anonymous
session. Existing SBR models often focus only on single-session information,
ignoring inter-session relationships and valuable cross-session insights. Some
methods try to include inter-session data but struggle with noise and
irrelevant information, reducing performance. Additionally, most models rely on
item ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their
ability to capture fine-grained item features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel hierarchical intent-guided optimization approach with pluggable
LLM-driven semantic learning for session-based recommendations, called HIPHOP.
First, we introduce a pluggable embedding module based on large language models
(LLMs) to generate high-quality semantic representations, enhancing item
embeddings. Second, HIPHOP utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item
transition relationships and incorporates a dynamic multi-intent capturing
module to address users' diverse interests within a session. Additionally, we
design a hierarchical inter-session similarity learning module, guided by user
intent, to capture global and local session relationships, effectively
exploring users' long-term and short-term interests. To mitigate noise, an
intent-guided denoising strategy is applied during inter-session learning.
Finally, we enhance the model's discriminative capability by using contrastive
learning to optimize session representations. Experiments on multiple datasets
show that HIPHOP significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving recommendation quality. Our code is available:

reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

Listwise Preference Alignment Optimization for Tail Item Recommendation,"Zihao Li, Chao Yang, Tong Zhang, Yakun Chen, Xianzhi Wang, Guandong Xu, Daoyi Dong",2025-07-03,2507.02255v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02255v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02255v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Preference alignment has achieved greater success on Large Language Models
(LLMs) and drawn broad interest in recommendation research. Existing preference
alignment methods for recommendation either require explicit reward modeling or
only support pairwise preference comparison. The former directly increases
substantial computational costs, while the latter hinders training efficiency
on negative samples. Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference
alignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we
propose LPO4Rec, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison
to listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training.
Specifically, we derive a closed form optimal policy to enable more efficient
and effective training without explicit reward modeling. We also present an
adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategy to prioritize tail items
during optimization and enhance performance in tail-item recommendations.
Besides, we theoretically prove that optimizing the listwise preference
optimization (LPO) loss is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the
optimal reward. Our experiments on three public datasets show that our method
outperforms 10 baselines by a large margin, achieving up to 50% performance
improvement while reducing 17.9% GPU memory usage when compared with direct

Confidence and Stability of Global and Pairwise Scores in NLP Evaluation,"Georgii Levtsov, Dmitry Ustalov",2025-07-02,2507.01633v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01633v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01633v1,information_retrieval,cs.CL,"With the advent of highly capable instruction-tuned neural language models,
benchmarking in natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly shifting
towards pairwise comparison leaderboards, such as LMSYS Arena, from traditional
global pointwise scores (e.g., GLUE, BIG-bench, SWE-bench). This paper
empirically investigates the strengths and weaknesses of both global scores and
pairwise comparisons to aid decision-making in selecting appropriate model
evaluation strategies. Through computational experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets using standard global metrics and the popular Bradley-Terry
model for pairwise comparisons, we found that while global scores provide more
reliable overall rankings, they can underestimate strong models with rare,
significant errors or low confidence. Conversely, pairwise comparisons are
particularly effective for identifying strong contenders among models with
lower global scores, especially where quality metrics are hard to define (e.g.,
text generation), though they require more comparisons to converge if ties are
frequent. Our code and data are available at

manually verified, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. We propose
a framework that performs uncertainty-aware data extraction for complex
scientific tables, built on conformal prediction, a model-agnostic method for
uncertainty quantification (UQ). We explored various uncertainty scoring
methods to aggregate the uncertainties introduced by TSR and OCR. We rigorously
evaluated the framework using a standard benchmark and an in-house dataset

demonstrate the effectiveness of using UQ for extraction error detection, and
by manually verifying only 47\% of extraction results, the data quality can be

resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive

query comprehension. To address this gap, we introduce MassTool, a multi-task
search-based framework designed to enhance both query representation and tool

detection tower that predicts the need for function calls, and a tool retrieval
tower that leverages a query-centric graph convolution network (QC-GCN) for
effective query-tool matching. It also incorporates search-based user intent
modeling (SUIM) to handle diverse and out-of-distribution queries, alongside an
adaptive knowledge transfer (AdaKT) module for efficient multi-task learning.
By jointly optimizing tool usage detection loss, list-wise retrieval loss, and
contrastive regularization loss, MassTool establishes a robust dual-step

users to interactively express their needs through natural language and obtain
personalized recommendations. Large language model-powered (LLM-powered) agents

capturing users' real-time needs and enhancing personalized experiences.
However, due to limited planning and generalization capabilities, existing
formulations of LLM-powered interactive recommender agents struggle to
effectively address diverse and complex user intents, such as intuitive,
unrefined, or occasionally ambiguous requests. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA)
that addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns.
Specifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring
a manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user
needs and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through
Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts
high-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover,
we designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries
of different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific
datasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets,
TAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods.
Notably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while
generalizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in
managing complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems. The

JointRank: Rank Large Set with Single Pass,Evgeny Dedov,2025-06-27,2506.22262v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22262v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22262v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Efficiently ranking relevant items from large candidate pools is a
cornerstone of modern information retrieval systems -- such as web search,

when processing large sets. We propose a model-agnostic method for fast
reranking large sets that exceed a model input limits. The method first
partitions candidate items into overlapping blocks, each of which is ranked
independently in parallel. Implicit pairwise comparisons are then derived from
these local rankings. Finally, these comparisons are aggregated to construct a
global ranking using algorithms such as Winrate or PageRank. Experiments on
