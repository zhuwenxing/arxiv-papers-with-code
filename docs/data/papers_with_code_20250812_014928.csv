eSASRec: Enhancing Transformer-based Recommendations in a Modular Fashion,"Daria Tikhonovich, Nikita Zelinskiy, Aleksandr V. Petrov, Mayya Spirina, Andrei Semenov, Andrey V. Savchenko, Sergei Kuliev",2025-08-08,2508.06450v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06450v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06450v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Since their introduction, Transformer-based models, such as SASRec and
BERT4Rec, have become common baselines for sequential recommendations,
surpassing earlier neural and non-neural methods. A number of following
publications have shown that the effectiveness of these models can be improved
by, for example, slightly updating the architecture of the Transformer layers,
using better training objectives, and employing improved loss functions.
However, the additivity of these modular improvements has not been
systematically benchmarked - this is the gap we aim to close in this paper.
Through our experiments, we identify a very strong model that uses SASRec's
training objective, LiGR Transformer layers, and Sampled Softmax Loss. We call
this combination eSASRec (Enhanced SASRec). While we primarily focus on
realistic, production-like evaluation, in our preliminarily study we find that
common academic benchmarks show eSASRec to be 23% more effective compared to
the most recent state-of-the-art models, such as ActionPiece. In our main
production-like benchmark, eSASRec resides on the Pareto frontier in terms of
the accuracy-coverage tradeoff (alongside the recent industrial models HSTU and
FuXi. As the modifications compared to the original SASRec are relatively
straightforward and no extra features are needed (such as timestamps in HSTU),
we believe that eSASRec can be easily integrated into existing recommendation
pipelines and can can serve as a strong yet very simple baseline for emerging
complicated algorithms. To facilitate this, we provide the open-source
implementations for our models and benchmarks in repository

Balancing Accuracy and Novelty with Sub-Item Popularity,"Chiara Mallamaci, Aleksandr Vladimirovich Petrov, Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino, Vito Walter Anelli, Tommaso Di Noia, Craig Macdonald",2025-08-07,2508.05198v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05198v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05198v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommenders have shown
promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. A key
characteristic of this domain is repetitive listening, where users frequently
replay familiar tracks. To capture these repetition patterns, recent research
has introduced Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS), which quantify
user-specific preferences based on historical frequency. While PPS enhances
relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content,
limiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key
elements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction. To address
this limitation, we build upon RecJPQ, a Transformer-based framework initially
developed to improve scalability in large-item catalogues through sub-item
decomposition. We repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model
personalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture
shared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings - latent structures not
accessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration
of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling
explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty.
Our sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by
achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising
recommendation accuracy. Code and experiments are publicly available at

HiD-VAE: Interpretable Generative Recommendation via Hierarchical and Disentangled Semantic IDs,"Dengzhao Fang, Jingtong Gao, Chengcheng Zhu, Yu Li, Xiangyu Zhao, Yi Chang",2025-08-06,2508.04618v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04618v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04618v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Recommender systems are indispensable for helping users navigate the immense
item catalogs of modern online platforms. Recently, generative recommendation
has emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional
retrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic
generation. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained
by their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from
two critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking
a coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement
(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.
To overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that
learns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core
innovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization
process that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more
uniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict
hierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for
each recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE
incorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space
overlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but
also promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive
utilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled
IDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models. Extensive
experiments on three public benchmarks validate HiD-VAE's superior performance
against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods
solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the
complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to
tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally
and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval.
These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video
moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or
background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end,
we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which
learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts
for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and
audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance
predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly
assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we
design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and
visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their
complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation
strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference.
To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e.,
Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and
re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability
in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness

integrating diverse semantic information from multiple modalities. However, the
assumption of the availability of all modalities rarely holds in practice due
to missing images, incomplete descriptions, or inconsistent user content. These
challenges significantly degrade the robustness and generalization capabilities

modality representation, which filters out task-irrelevant modality information
while maximally preserving essential features relevant to recommendation. By
treating each modality as a distinct semantic environment, I$^3$-MRec employs
invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn modality-specific item

Information Bottleneck (IB) principle extracts compact and effective item
embeddings by suppressing modality noise and preserving core user preference

Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network for Remote Sensing Images Segmentation,"Junyi Wang, Jinjiang Li, Guodong Fan, Yakun Ju, Xiang Fang, Alex C.

ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.

distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical
relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that
lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose
MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source

implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both
graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable

intricate Top-$K$ truncation. Recent efforts to optimize NDCG@$K$ have either
overlooked the Top-$K$ truncation or suffered from high computational costs and

Specifically, we integrate the quantile technique to handle Top-$K$ truncation

with significant progress made in accurately measuring the similarity between
cross-modal pairs. However, the persistent hubness problem, a phenomenon where
a small number of targets frequently appear as nearest neighbors to numerous

several proposed methods to reduce hubness, their underlying mechanisms remain
poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we analyze the widely-adopted Inverted
Softmax approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing target
probabilities during retrieval. Building on these insights, we propose a
probability-balancing framework for more effective hubness reduction. We
contend that balancing target probabilities alone is inadequate and, therefore,
extend the framework to balance both query and target probabilities by
introducing Sinkhorn Normalization (SN). Notably, we extend SN to scenarios
where the true query distribution is unknown, showing that current methods,
which rely solely on a query bank to estimate target hubness, produce
suboptimal results due to a significant distributional gap between the query
bank and targets. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Dual Bank Sinkhorn
Normalization (DBSN), incorporating a corresponding target bank alongside the
query bank to narrow this distributional gap. Our comprehensive evaluation
across various cross-modal retrieval tasks, including image-text retrieval,

Graph-Structured Data Analysis of Component Failure in Autonomous Cargo Ships Based on Feature Fusion,"Zizhao Zhang, Tianxiang Zhao, Yu Sun, Liping Sun, Jichuan Kang",2025-07-18,2507.13721v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13721v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13721v1,databases,cs.LG,"To address the challenges posed by cascading reactions caused by component
failures in autonomous cargo ships (ACS) and the uncertainties in emergency
decision-making, this paper proposes a novel hybrid feature fusion framework
for constructing a graph-structured dataset of failure modes. By employing an
improved cuckoo search algorithm (HN-CSA), the literature retrieval efficiency
is significantly enhanced, achieving improvements of 7.1% and 3.4% compared to
the NSGA-II and CSA search algorithms, respectively. A hierarchical feature
fusion framework is constructed, using Word2Vec encoding to encode
subsystem/component features, BERT-KPCA to process failure modes/reasons, and
Sentence-BERT to quantify the semantic association between failure impact and
emergency decision-making. The dataset covers 12 systems, 1,262 failure modes,
and 6,150 propagation paths. Validation results show that the GATE-GNN model
achieves a classification accuracy of 0.735, comparable to existing benchmarks.
Additionally, a silhouette coefficient of 0.641 indicates that the features are
highly distinguishable. In the label prediction results, the Shore-based
Meteorological Service System achieved an F1 score of 0.93, demonstrating high
prediction accuracy. This paper not only provides a solid foundation for
failure analysis in autonomous cargo ships but also offers reliable support for
fault diagnosis, risk assessment, and intelligent decision-making systems. The

TOPJoin: A Context-Aware Multi-Criteria Approach for Joinable Column Search,"Harsha Kokel, Aamod Khatiwada, Tejaswini Pedapati, Haritha Ananthakrishnan, Oktie Hassanzadeh, Horst Samulowitz, Kavitha Srinivas",2025-07-15,2507.11505v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11505v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11505v1,databases,cs.DB,"One of the major challenges in enterprise data analysis is the task of
finding joinable tables that are conceptually related and provide meaningful
insights. Traditionally, joinable tables have been discovered through a search
for similar columns, where two columns are considered similar syntactically if
there is a set overlap or they are considered similar semantically if either
the column embeddings or value embeddings are closer in the embedding space.
However, for enterprise data lakes, column similarity is not sufficient to
identify joinable columns and tables. The context of the query column is
important. Hence, in this work, we first define context-aware column
joinability. Then we propose a multi-criteria approach, called TOPJoin, for
joinable column search. We evaluate TOPJoin against existing join search
baselines over one academic and one real-world join search benchmark. Through
experiments, we find that TOPJoin performs better on both benchmarks than the
baselines.",https://github.com/IBM/ContextAwareJoin,"VLDB 2025 Workshop: Tabular Data Analysis (TaDA); The source code,
