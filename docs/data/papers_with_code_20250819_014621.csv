PaperRegister: Boosting Flexible-grained Paper Search via Hierarchical Register Indexing,"Zhuoqun Li, Xuanang Chen, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun",2025-08-14,2508.11116v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11116v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11116v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Paper search is an important activity for researchers, typically involving
using a query with description of a topic to find relevant papers. As research
deepens, paper search requirements may become more flexible, sometimes
involving specific details such as module configuration rather than being
limited to coarse-grained topics. However, previous paper search systems are
unable to meet these flexible-grained requirements, as these systems mainly
collect paper abstracts to construct index of corpus, which lack detailed
information to support retrieval by finer-grained queries. In this work, we
propose PaperRegister, consisted of offline hierarchical indexing and online
adaptive retrieval, transforming traditional abstract-based index into
hierarchical index tree for paper search, thereby supporting queries at
flexible granularity. Experiments on paper search tasks across a range of
granularity demonstrate that PaperRegister achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, and particularly excels in fine-grained scenarios, highlighting
the good potential as an effective solution for flexible-grained paper search
in real-world applications. Code for this work is in

STEP: Stepwise Curriculum Learning for Context-Knowledge Fusion in Conversational Recommendation,"Zhenye Yang, Jinpeng Chen, Huan Li, Xiongnan Jin, Xuanyang Li, Junwei Zhang, Hongbo Gao, Kaimin Wei, Senzhang Wang",2025-08-14,2508.10669v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10669v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10669v1,information_retrieval,cs.AI,"Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.",https://github.com/Alex-bupt/STEP,"10 pages; 4 figures; 6 tables; code available at

larger, more versatile systems but mean greater latency and training costs. To
accelerate training and inference, we investigated the recent generative
recommendation models HSTU and FuXi-$\alpha$, identifying two efficiency
bottlenecks: the indexing operations in relative temporal attention bias and
the computation of the query-key attention map. Additionally, we observed that
relative attention bias in self-attention mechanisms can also serve as
attention maps. Previous works like Synthesizer have shown that alternative
forms of attention maps can achieve similar performance, naturally raising the
question of whether some attention maps are redundant. Through empirical
experiments, we discovered that using the query-key attention map might degrade
the model's performance in recommendation tasks. To address these bottlenecks,
we propose a new framework applicable to Transformer-like recommendation
models. On one hand, we introduce Functional Relative Attention Bias, which
avoids the time-consuming operations of the original relative attention bias,
thereby accelerating the process. On the other hand, we remove the query-key
attention map from the original self-attention layer and design a new
Attention-Free Token Mixer module. Furthermore, by applying this framework to
FuXi-$\alpha$, we introduce a new model, FuXi-$\beta$. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that FuXi-$\beta$ outperforms previous
state-of-the-art models and achieves significant acceleration compared to
FuXi-$\alpha$, while also adhering to the scaling law. Notably, FuXi-$\beta$
shows an improvement of 27% to 47% in the NDCG@10 metric on large-scale

\textbf{TFRank}, an efficient pointwise reasoning ranker based on small-scale

employing a ``think-mode switch'' and pointwise format constraints.
Specifically, this allows the model to leverage explicit reasoning during

propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head

skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a
Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that
captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to

leverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an
agent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning
(RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data

At the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides

challenge, particularly for named entity recognition (NER) in the architecture,

complex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be
mitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as
exemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and
cost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative. However,
the optimal strategy for generating knowledge that can genuinely enhance
smaller, efficient models remains an open question. To address this, we propose
ARCE (augmented RoBERTa with contextualized elucidations), a novel approach

employs an LLM to first generate a corpus of simple, direct explanations, which
we term Cote, and then uses this corpus to incrementally pre-train a RoBERTa
model prior to its fine-tuning on the downstream task. Our extensive
experiments show that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark

using better training objectives, and employing improved loss functions.
However, the additivity of these modular improvements has not been
systematically benchmarked - this is the gap we aim to close in this paper.
Through our experiments, we identify a very strong model that uses SASRec's
training objective, LiGR Transformer layers, and Sampled Softmax Loss. We call
this combination eSASRec (Enhanced SASRec). While we primarily focus on
realistic, production-like evaluation, in our preliminarily study we find that
common academic benchmarks show eSASRec to be 23% more effective compared to
the most recent state-of-the-art models, such as ActionPiece. In our main
production-like benchmark, eSASRec resides on the Pareto frontier in terms of
the accuracy-coverage tradeoff (alongside the recent industrial models HSTU and
FuXi. As the modifications compared to the original SASRec are relatively
straightforward and no extra features are needed (such as timestamps in HSTU),
we believe that eSASRec can be easily integrated into existing recommendation

multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
