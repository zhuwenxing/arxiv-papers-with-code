NewsReX: A More Efficient Approach to News Recommendation with Keras 3 and JAX,"Igor L. R. Azevedo, Toyotaro Suzumura, Yuichiro Yasui",2025-08-29,2508.21572v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21572v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21572v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Reproducing and comparing results in news recommendation research has become
increasingly difficult. This is due to a fragmented ecosystem of diverse
codebases, varied configurations, and mainly due to resource-intensive models.
We introduce NewsReX, an open-source library designed to streamline this
process. Our key contribution is a modern implementation built on Keras 3 and
JAX, which provides an increase in computational efficiency. Experiments show
that NewsReX is faster than current implementations. To support broader
research, we provide a straightforward guide and scripts for training models on
custom datasets. We validated this functionality using a proprietary Japanese
news dataset from Nikkei News, a leading Japanese media corporation renowned
for its comprehensive coverage of business, economic, and financial news.
NewsReX makes reproducing complex experiments faster and more accessible to a
wider range of hardware making sure the speed up it also achieved for less
powerful GPUs, like an 8GB RTX 3060 Ti. Beyond the library, this paper offers
an analysis of key training parameters often overlooked in the literature,
including the effect of different negative sampling strategies, the varying
number of epochs, the impact of random batching, and more. This supplementary
analysis serves as a valuable reference for future research, aiming to reduce
redundant computation when comparing baselines and guide best practices. Code

Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network for Click-through Rate Prediction,"Xiaoxi Cui, Weihai Lu, Yu Tong, Yiheng Li, Zhejun Zhao",2025-08-29,2508.21460v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21460v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21460v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to
model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods
are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to
comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is
necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing
to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate
prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle
commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to
consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex
interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based
Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through
prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal
Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,
and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC
Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different
modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,
improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among
different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the
FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To
validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive
experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results
demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least
1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing
multi-modal recommendation systems. Our code is available at the following

systems (RSs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to
simulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain
alignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale
simulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is
the extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such
feedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is
often ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference
alignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the
efficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering
mechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we
introduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in

Our framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate
cognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing
ambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty
estimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation
samples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using
such high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes.
Extensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the

Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice

systematically evaluate this limitation, we introduce two targeted tasks,
keyword retrieval and part-of-passage retrieval, designed to simulate practical
fine-grained scenarios. Motivated by these observations, we propose
LexSemBridge, a unified framework that enhances dense query representations

PGTuner: An Efficient Framework for Automatic and Transferable Configuration Tuning of Proximity Graphs,"Hao Duan, Yitong Song, Bin Yao, Anqi Liang",2025-08-25,2508.17886v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17886v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17886v1,databases,cs.DB,"Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a crucial role in many key
areas. Proximity graphs (PGs) are the leading method for ANNS, offering the
best balance between query efficiency and accuracy. However, their performance
heavily depends on various construction and query parameters, which are
difficult to optimize due to their complex inter-dependencies. Given that users
often prioritize specific accuracy levels, efficiently identifying the optimal
PG configurations to meet these targets is essential. Although some studies
have explored automatic configuration tuning for PGs, they are limited by
inefficiencies and suboptimal results. These issues stem from the need to
construct numerous PGs for searching and re-tuning from scratch whenever the
dataset changes, as well as the failure to capture the complex dependencies
between configurations, query performance, and tuning objectives.
  To address these challenges, we propose PGTuner, an efficient framework for
automatic PG configuration tuning leveraging pre-training knowledge and model
transfer techniques. PGTuner improves efficiency through a pre-trained query
performance prediction (QPP) model, eliminating the need to build multiple PGs.
It also features a deep reinforcement learning-based parameter configuration
recommendation (PCR) model to recommend optimal configurations for specific
datasets and accuracy targets. Additionally, PGTuner incorporates
out-of-distribution detection and deep active learning for efficient tuning in
dynamic scenarios and transferring to new datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PGTuner can stably achieve the top-level tuning effect across
different datasets while significantly improving tuning efficiency by up to
14.69X, with a 14.64X boost in dynamic scenarios. The code and data for PGTuner

Attribute Filtering in Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search: An In-depth Experimental Study,"Mocheng Li, Xiao Yan, Baotong Lu, Yue Zhang, James Cheng, Chenhao Ma",2025-08-22,2508.16263v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16263v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16263v1,databases,cs.DB,"With the growing integration of structured and unstructured data, new methods
have emerged for performing similarity searches on vectors while honoring
structured attribute constraints, i.e., a process known as Filtering
Approximate Nearest Neighbor (Filtering ANN) search. Since many of these
algorithms have only appeared in recent years and are designed to work with a
variety of base indexing methods and filtering strategies, there is a pressing
need for a unified analysis that identifies their core techniques and enables
meaningful comparisons.
  In this work, we present a unified Filtering ANN search interface that
encompasses the latest algorithms and evaluate them extensively from multiple
perspectives. First, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing Filtering
ANN algorithms based on attribute types and filtering strategies. Next, we
analyze their key components, i.e., index structures, pruning strategies, and
entry point selection, to elucidate design differences and tradeoffs. We then
conduct a broad experimental evaluation on 10 algorithms and 12 methods across
4 datasets (each with up to 10 million items), incorporating both synthetic and
real attributes and covering selectivity levels from 0.1% to 100%. Finally, an
in-depth component analysis reveals the influence of pruning, entry point
selection, and edge filtering costs on overall performance. Based on our
findings, we summarize the strengths and limitations of each approach, provide
practical guidelines for selecting appropriate methods, and suggest promising
directions for future research. Our code is available at:

AmbiSQL: Interactive Ambiguity Detection and Resolution for Text-to-SQL,"Zhongjun Ding, Yin Lin, Tianjing Zeng",2025-08-21,2508.15276v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15276v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15276v1,databases,cs.DB,"Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

Cold-RL: Learning Cache Eviction with Offline Reinforcement Learning for NGINX,"Aayush Gupta, Arpit Bhayani",2025-08-17,2508.12485v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12485v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12485v1,databases,cs.LG,"Web proxies such as NGINX commonly rely on least-recently-used (LRU)
eviction, which is size agnostic and can thrash under periodic bursts and mixed
object sizes. We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that
replaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an
ONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL
samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features
(age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT),
and requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers
immediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying
NGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained
object earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against
LRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial
workloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538,
a 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from
0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods
(about 0.918). Inference adds less than 2 percent CPU overhead and keeps 95th
percentile eviction latency within budget. To our knowledge, this is the first

Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

"Synthesize, Retrieve, and Propagate: A Unified Predictive Modeling Framework for Relational Databases","Ning Li, Kounianhua Du, Han Zhang, Quan Gan, Minjie Wang, David Wipf, Weinan Zhang",2025-08-10,2508.08327v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08327v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08327v1,databases,cs.DB,"Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing
massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released
