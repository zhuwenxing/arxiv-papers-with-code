    "abstract": "Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR\nrecords, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical\ndecision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative\ncapabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,\nand challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but\noften struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval\nstrategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by\nmetadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The\nframework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains\ntabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing\noptimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and\nconversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5\nincreased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative\nevaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness\n(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.\nThese results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,\ncomprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future\nwork includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based\nretrieval. The source code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot",

    "abstract": "Graph knowledge has been proven effective in enhancing item rankings in\nrecommender systems (RecSys), particularly during the retrieval stage. However,\nits application in the ranking stage, especially when richer contextual\ninformation in user-item interactions is available, remains underexplored. A\nmajor challenge lies in the substantial computational cost associated with\nrepeatedly retrieving neighborhood information from billions of items stored in\ndistributed systems. This resource-intensive requirement makes it difficult to\nscale graph-based methods in practical RecSys. To bridge this gap, we first\ndemonstrate that incorporating graphs in the ranking stage improves ranking\nqualities. Notably, while the improvement is evident, we show that the\nsubstantial computational overheads entailed by graphs are prohibitively\nexpensive for real-world recommendations. In light of this, we propose a\nnon-parametric strategy that utilizes graph convolution for re-ranking only\nduring test time. Our strategy circumvents the notorious computational\noverheads from graph convolution during training, and utilizes structural\nknowledge hidden in graphs on-the-fly during testing. It can be used as a\nplug-and-play module and easily employed to enhance the ranking ability of\nvarious ranking layers of a real-world RecSys with significantly reduced\ncomputational overhead. Through comprehensive experiments across four benchmark\ndatasets with varying levels of sparsity, we demonstrate that our strategy\nyields noticeable improvements (i.e., 8.1% on average) during testing time with\nlittle to no additional computational overheads (i.e., 0.5 on average).

These approaches face significant limitations as\nthey cannot perform instant diagnosis for new learners without computationally\nexpensive retraining and produce diagnostic outputs with limited reliability.\nIn this study, we introduces a novel generative diagnosis paradigm that\nfundamentally shifts CD from predictive to generative modeling, enabling\ninductive inference of cognitive states without parameter re-optimization. We\npropose two simple yet effective instantiations of this paradigm: Generative\nItem Response Theory (G-IRT) and Generative Neural Cognitive Diagnosis Model\n(G-NCDM), which achieve excellent performance improvements over traditional\nmethods. The generative approach disentangles cognitive state inference from\nresponse prediction through a well-designed generation process that\nincorporates identifiability and monotonicity conditions.

    "abstract": "Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer\nvision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face\nchallenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among\nsimilar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft\npositive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft\nnegative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching\nuncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the\nneighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training\nbatches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.\nThis paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning\nframework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified\nrepresentation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,\neffectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework\nintroduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive\naggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic\nunderstanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and\ninter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships\namong sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic\ninteractions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum\ncontrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined\nstrategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between\nfeatures. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,\nconsiderably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching.

Unlike existing approaches that focus primarily on\ninter-layer redundancy, we uncover intra-layer redundancy within components\nsuch as self-attention and MLP modules. Building on this analysis, we propose a\nmore fine-grained pruning approach that integrates both intra-layer and\nlayer-wise pruning.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models, known for their generative ability to simulate data\ncreation through noise-adding and denoising processes, have emerged as a\npromising approach for building generative recommenders. To incorporate user\nhistory for personalization, existing methods typically adopt a conditional\ndiffusion framework, where the reverse denoising process of reconstructing\nitems from noise is modified to be conditioned on the user history. However,\nthis design may fail to fully utilize historical information, as it gets\ndistracted by the need to model the \"item $\\leftrightarrow$ noise\" translation.\nThis motivates us to reformulate the diffusion process for sequential\nrecommendation in an unconditional manner, treating user history (instead of\nnoise) as the endpoint of the forward diffusion process (i.e., the starting\npoint of the reverse process), rather than as a conditional input. This\nformulation allows for exclusive focus on modeling the \"item $\\leftrightarrow$\nhistory\" translation. To this end, we introduce Brownian Bridge Diffusion\nRecommendation (BBDRec).

    "abstract": "Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation (SASRec) effectively captures\nlong-term user preferences by applying attention mechanisms to historical\ninteractions. Concurrently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nmotivated research into LLM-based recommendation, which leverages their\npowerful generalization and language understanding capabilities. However, LLMs\noften lack the domain-specific knowledge and collaborative signals essential\nfor high-quality recommendations when relying solely on textual prompts. To\naddress this limitation, this study proposes SASRecLLM, a novel framework that\nintegrates SASRec as a collaborative encoder with an LLM fine-tuned using\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The components are connected via a mapping layer to\nalign their dimensional spaces, and three targeted training strategies are\ndesigned to optimize the hybrid architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple\ndatasets demonstrate that SASRecLLM achieves robust and consistent improvements\nover strong baselines in both cold-start and warm-start scenarios. This work\nadvances the field of LLM-based recommendation by presenting a modular and\neffective paradigm for fusing structured collaborative filtering with the\nsemantic power of fine-tuned LLMs. The implementation is available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kechenkristin/RecLLM",

    "abstract": "Most existing multimodal collaborative filtering recommendation (MCFRec)\nmethods rely heavily on ID features and multimodal content to enhance\nrecommendation performance. However, this paper reveals that ID features are\neffective but have limited benefits in multimodal collaborative filtering\nrecommendation. Therefore, this paper systematically deconstruct the pros and\ncons of ID features: (i) they provide initial embedding but lack semantic\nrichness, (ii) they provide a unique identifier for each user and item but\nhinder generalization to untrained data, and (iii) they assist in aligning and\nfusing multimodal features but may lead to representation shift. Based on these\ninsights, this paper proposes IDFREE, an ID-free multimodal collaborative\nFiltering REcommEndation baseline. IDFREE replaces ID features with multimodal\nfeatures and positional encodings to generate semantically meaningful ID-free\nembeddings. For ID-free multimodal collaborative filtering, it further proposes\nan adaptive similarity graph module to construct dynamic user-user and\nitem-item graphs based on multimodal features. Then, an augmented user-item\ngraph encoder is proposed to construct more effective user and item encoding.\nFinally, IDFREE achieves inter-multimodal alignment based on the contrastive\nlearning and uses Softmax loss as recommendation loss. Basic experiments on\nthree public datasets demonstrate that IDFREE outperforms existing ID-based\nMCFRec methods, achieving an average performance gain of 72.24% across standard\nmetrics (Recall@5, 10, 20, 50 and NDCG@5, 10, 20, 50). Exploratory and extended\nexperiments further validate our findings on the limitations of ID features in\nMCFRec. The code is released at https://github.com/G-H-Li/IDFREE.",

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges in enterprise data analysis is the task of\nfinding joinable tables that are conceptually related and provide meaningful\ninsights. Traditionally, joinable tables have been discovered through a search\nfor similar columns, where two columns are considered similar syntactically if\nthere is a set overlap or they are considered similar semantically if either\nthe column embeddings or value embeddings are closer in the embedding space.\nHowever, for enterprise data lakes, column similarity is not sufficient to\nidentify joinable columns and tables. The context of the query column is\nimportant. Hence, in this work, we first define context-aware column\njoinability. Then we propose a multi-criteria approach, called TOPJoin, for\njoinable column search. We evaluate TOPJoin against existing join search\nbaselines over one academic and one real-world join search benchmark. Through\nexperiments, we find that TOPJoin performs better on both benchmarks than the\nbaselines.",
