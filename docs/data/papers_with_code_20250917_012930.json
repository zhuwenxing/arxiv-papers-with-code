    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enhance recommender systems but face challenges from\ninherent noise, sparsity, and Euclidean geometry's inadequacy for complex\nrelational structures, critically impairing representation learning, especially\nfor long-tail entities. Existing methods also often lack adaptive multi-source\nsignal fusion tailored to item popularity. This paper introduces SPARK, a novel\nmulti-stage framework systematically tackling these issues. SPARK first employs\nTucker low-rank decomposition to denoise KGs and generate robust entity\nrepresentations. Subsequently, an SVD-initialized hybrid geometric GNN\nconcurrently learns representations in Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces; the\nlatter is strategically leveraged for its aptitude in modeling hierarchical\nstructures, effectively capturing semantic features of sparse, long-tail items.\nA core contribution is an item popularity-aware adaptive fusion strategy that\ndynamically weights signals from collaborative filtering, refined KG\nembeddings, and diverse geometric spaces for precise modeling of both\nmainstream and long-tail items. Finally, contrastive learning aligns these\nmulti-source representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPARK's\nsignificant superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in\nimproving long-tail item recommendation, offering a robust, principled approach\nto knowledge-enhanced recommendation.

However, most existing methods\nrely on either static fusion strategies or graph-based local interaction\nmodeling, facing two critical limitations: (1) insufficient ability to model\nfine-grained cross-modal associations, leading to suboptimal fusion quality;\nand (2) a lack of global distribution-level consistency, causing\nrepresentational bias. To address these, we propose MambaRec, a novel framework\nthat integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization\nvia attention-guided learning. At its core, we introduce the Dilated Refinement\nAttention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with\nchannel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns\nbetween visual and textual modalities. This module captures hierarchical\nrelationships and context-aware associations, improving cross-modal semantic\nmodeling. Additionally, we apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive\nloss functions to constrain global modality alignment, enhancing semantic\nconsistency. This dual regularization reduces mode-specific deviations and\nboosts robustness. To improve scalability, MambaRec employs a dimensionality\nreduction strategy to lower the computational cost of high-dimensional\nmultimodal features.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive\nperformance in passage reranking tasks. Despite their success, LLM-based\nmethods still face challenges in efficiency and sensitivity to external biases.\n(1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window\nstrategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the\nnumber of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or\nselection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and\nincrease input-order sensitivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a\nnovel passage reranking model, called Multi-View-guided Passage Reranking\n(MVP). MVP is a non-generative LLM-based reranking method that encodes\nquery-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced\nby external biases. For each view, it combines query-aware passage embeddings\nto produce a distinct anchor vector, which is then used to directly compute\nrelevance scores in a single decoding step. In addition, it employs an\northogonal loss to make the views more distinctive. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MVP, with just 220M parameters, matches the performance of\nmuch larger 7B-scale fine-tuned models while achieving a 100x reduction in\ninference latency.

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address\nthis limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document\ncomprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate\nthis by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,\nignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential\nfor reasoning.\n  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for\nmulti-modal, multi-page document understanding.

However, existing methods are typically limited to\nextracting a single type of relational triplet, which restricts their ability\nto extract triplets beyond the specified types. Directly combining these\nmethods fails to capture dynamic cross-modal interactions and introduces\nsignificant computational redundancy. Therefore, we propose a novel\n\\textit{unified multimodal Relation Extraction framework with Multilevel\nOptimal Transport and mixture-of-Experts}, termed REMOTE, which can\nsimultaneously extract intra-modal and inter-modal relations between textual\nentities and visual objects. To dynamically select optimal interaction features\nfor different types of relational triplets, we introduce mixture-of-experts\nmechanism, ensuring the most relevant modality information is utilized.\nAdditionally, considering that the inherent property of multilayer sequential\nencoding in existing encoders often leads to the loss of low-level information,\nwe adopt a multilevel optimal transport fusion module to preserve low-level\nfeatures while maintaining multilayer encoding, yielding more expressive\nrepresentations. Correspondingly, we also create a Unified Multimodal Relation\nExtraction (UMRE) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework,\nencompassing diverse cases where the head and tail entities can originate from\neither text or image.

Recently, there has been a surge of\ninterest in graph-based ANNS algorithms due to their superior efficiency and\naccuracy. However, the repeated computation of distances in high-dimensional\nspaces constitutes the primary time cost of graph-based methods. To accelerate\nthe search, we propose a novel routing strategy named CRouting, which bypasses\nunnecessary distance computations by exploiting the angle distributions of\nhigh-dimensional vectors. CRouting is designed as a plugin to optimize existing\ngraph-based search with minimal code modifications. Our experiments show that\nCRouting reduces the number of distance computations by up to 41.5% and boosts\nqueries per second by up to 1.48$\\times$ on two predominant graph indexes, HNSW\nand NSG.

    "abstract": "Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,\nfinancial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve\nflexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).\nThese tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and\nanswer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To\nautomate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,\nmethods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured\nones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like\nNL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of\nsemi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To\nthis end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured\ntable question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the\nHierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures\ncomplex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for\nconstructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to\nguide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor\ndecomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree\noperation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate\npipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:\nforward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward\nvalidation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from\npredicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of\n764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that\nST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code\nis available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.",

    "abstract": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a crucial role in many key\nareas. Proximity graphs (PGs) are the leading method for ANNS, offering the\nbest balance between query efficiency and accuracy. However, their performance\nheavily depends on various construction and query parameters, which are\ndifficult to optimize due to their complex inter-dependencies. Given that users\noften prioritize specific accuracy levels, efficiently identifying the optimal\nPG configurations to meet these targets is essential. Although some studies\nhave explored automatic configuration tuning for PGs, they are limited by\ninefficiencies and suboptimal results. These issues stem from the need to\nconstruct numerous PGs for searching and re-tuning from scratch whenever the\ndataset changes, as well as the failure to capture the complex dependencies\nbetween configurations, query performance, and tuning objectives.\n  To address these challenges, we propose PGTuner, an efficient framework for\nautomatic PG configuration tuning leveraging pre-training knowledge and model\ntransfer techniques. PGTuner improves efficiency through a pre-trained query\nperformance prediction (QPP) model, eliminating the need to build multiple PGs.\nIt also features a deep reinforcement learning-based parameter configuration\nrecommendation (PCR) model to recommend optimal configurations for specific\ndatasets and accuracy targets. Additionally, PGTuner incorporates\nout-of-distribution detection and deep active learning for efficient tuning in\ndynamic scenarios and transferring to new datasets. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that PGTuner can stably achieve the top-level tuning effect across\ndifferent datasets while significantly improving tuning efficiency by up to\n14.69X, with a 14.64X boost in dynamic scenarios. The code and data for PGTuner\nare available online at https://github.com/hao-duan/PGTuner.",
