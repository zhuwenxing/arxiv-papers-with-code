While\nexisting datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication\nsections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific\ntexts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized\nbenchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text\nNLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to\nexisting research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations\nof entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the\neffectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar\ndatasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on\nthis dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models\nacross academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing\ndatasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on\ncertain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented\nautomatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.\nOur KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic\ntopological information that enhances downstream applications.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive\nperformance in passage reranking tasks. Despite their success, LLM-based\nmethods still face challenges in efficiency and sensitivity to external biases.\n(1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window\nstrategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the\nnumber of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or\nselection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and\nincrease input-order sensitivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a\nnovel passage reranking model, called Multi-View-guided Passage Reranking\n(MVP). MVP is a non-generative LLM-based reranking method that encodes\nquery-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced\nby external biases. For each view, it combines query-aware passage embeddings\nto produce a distinct anchor vector, which is then used to directly compute\nrelevance scores in a single decoding step. In addition, it employs an\northogonal loss to make the views more distinctive. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MVP, with just 220M parameters, matches the performance of\nmuch larger 7B-scale fine-tuned models while achieving a 100x reduction in\ninference latency. Notably, the 3B-parameter variant of MVP achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.\nThe source code is available at: https://github.com/bulbna/MVP",

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address\nthis limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document\ncomprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate\nthis by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,\nignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential\nfor reasoning.\n  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for\nmulti-modal, multi-page document understanding.

However, existing methods are typically limited to\nextracting a single type of relational triplet, which restricts their ability\nto extract triplets beyond the specified types. Directly combining these\nmethods fails to capture dynamic cross-modal interactions and introduces\nsignificant computational redundancy. Therefore, we propose a novel\n\\textit{unified multimodal Relation Extraction framework with Multilevel\nOptimal Transport and mixture-of-Experts}, termed REMOTE, which can\nsimultaneously extract intra-modal and inter-modal relations between textual\nentities and visual objects. To dynamically select optimal interaction features\nfor different types of relational triplets, we introduce mixture-of-experts\nmechanism, ensuring the most relevant modality information is utilized.\nAdditionally, considering that the inherent property of multilayer sequential\nencoding in existing encoders often leads to the loss of low-level information,\nwe adopt a multilevel optimal transport fusion module to preserve low-level\nfeatures while maintaining multilayer encoding, yielding more expressive\nrepresentations. Correspondingly, we also create a Unified Multimodal Relation\nExtraction (UMRE) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework,\nencompassing diverse cases where the head and tail entities can originate from\neither text or image.

This problem is magnified if\nretrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to\npromulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG\nrobustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs\nand ground-truth answers.

    "abstract": "Minimally curated tabular data often contain representational inconsistencies\nacross heterogeneous sources, and are accompanied by sparse metadata. Working\nwith such data is intimidating. While prior work has advanced dataset discovery\nand exploration, schema inference remains difficult when metadata are limited.\nWe present SI-LLM (Schema Inference using Large Language Models), which infers\na concise conceptual schema for tabular data using only column headers and cell\nvalues. The inferred schema comprises hierarchical entity types, attributes,\nand inter-type relationships. In extensive evaluation on two datasets from web\ntables and open data, SI-LLM achieves promising end-to-end results, as well as\nbetter or comparable results to state-of-the-art methods at each step.

    "abstract": "Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a crucial problem in\ninformation retrieval and AI applications. Recently, there has been a surge of\ninterest in graph-based ANNS algorithms due to their superior efficiency and\naccuracy. However, the repeated computation of distances in high-dimensional\nspaces constitutes the primary time cost of graph-based methods. To accelerate\nthe search, we propose a novel routing strategy named CRouting, which bypasses\nunnecessary distance computations by exploiting the angle distributions of\nhigh-dimensional vectors. CRouting is designed as a plugin to optimize existing\ngraph-based search with minimal code modifications. Our experiments show that\nCRouting reduces the number of distance computations by up to 41.5% and boosts\nqueries per second by up to 1.48$\\times$ on two predominant graph indexes, HNSW\nand NSG.

    "abstract": "Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,\nfinancial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve\nflexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).\nThese tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and\nanswer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To\nautomate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,\nmethods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured\nones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like\nNL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of\nsemi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To\nthis end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured\ntable question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the\nHierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures\ncomplex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for\nconstructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to\nguide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor\ndecomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree\noperation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate\npipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:\nforward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward\nvalidation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from\npredicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of\n764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that\nST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code\nis available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.",

    "abstract": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a crucial role in many key\nareas. Proximity graphs (PGs) are the leading method for ANNS, offering the\nbest balance between query efficiency and accuracy. However, their performance\nheavily depends on various construction and query parameters, which are\ndifficult to optimize due to their complex inter-dependencies. Given that users\noften prioritize specific accuracy levels, efficiently identifying the optimal\nPG configurations to meet these targets is essential. Although some studies\nhave explored automatic configuration tuning for PGs, they are limited by\ninefficiencies and suboptimal results. These issues stem from the need to\nconstruct numerous PGs for searching and re-tuning from scratch whenever the\ndataset changes, as well as the failure to capture the complex dependencies\nbetween configurations, query performance, and tuning objectives.\n  To address these challenges, we propose PGTuner, an efficient framework for\nautomatic PG configuration tuning leveraging pre-training knowledge and model\ntransfer techniques. PGTuner improves efficiency through a pre-trained query\nperformance prediction (QPP) model, eliminating the need to build multiple PGs.\nIt also features a deep reinforcement learning-based parameter configuration\nrecommendation (PCR) model to recommend optimal configurations for specific\ndatasets and accuracy targets. Additionally, PGTuner incorporates\nout-of-distribution detection and deep active learning for efficient tuning in\ndynamic scenarios and transferring to new datasets. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that PGTuner can stably achieve the top-level tuning effect across\ndifferent datasets while significantly improving tuning efficiency by up to\n14.69X, with a 14.64X boost in dynamic scenarios. The code and data for PGTuner\nare available online at https://github.com/hao-duan/PGTuner.",

    "abstract": "With the growing integration of structured and unstructured data, new methods\nhave emerged for performing similarity searches on vectors while honoring\nstructured attribute constraints, i.e., a process known as Filtering\nApproximate Nearest Neighbor (Filtering ANN) search. Since many of these\nalgorithms have only appeared in recent years and are designed to work with a\nvariety of base indexing methods and filtering strategies, there is a pressing\nneed for a unified analysis that identifies their core techniques and enables\nmeaningful comparisons.\n  In this work, we present a unified Filtering ANN search interface that\nencompasses the latest algorithms and evaluate them extensively from multiple\nperspectives. First, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing Filtering\nANN algorithms based on attribute types and filtering strategies. Next, we\nanalyze their key components, i.e., index structures, pruning strategies, and\nentry point selection, to elucidate design differences and tradeoffs. We then\nconduct a broad experimental evaluation on 10 algorithms and 12 methods across\n4 datasets (each with up to 10 million items), incorporating both synthetic and\nreal attributes and covering selectivity levels from 0.1% to 100%. Finally, an\nin-depth component analysis reveals the influence of pruning, entry point\nselection, and edge filtering costs on overall performance. Based on our\nfindings, we summarize the strengths and limitations of each approach, provide\npractical guidelines for selecting appropriate methods, and suggest promising\ndirections for future research.

    "abstract": "Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,\nproviding substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models\n(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query\nambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL\nsystems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL\ngeneration. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically\ndetects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice\nquestions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained\nambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element\nmapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous\nquestions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves\n87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by\n50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the\nsignificant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.\nCode repo and demonstration are available at:\nhttps://github.com/JustinzjDing/AmbiSQL.",
