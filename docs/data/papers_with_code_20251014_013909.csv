Hierarchical Semantic RL: Tackling the Problem of Dynamic Action Space for RL-based Recommendations,"Minmao Wang, Xingchen Liu, Shijie Yi, Likang Wu, Hongke Zhao, Fei Pan, Qingpeng Cai, Peng Jiang",2025-10-10,2510.09167v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09167v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09167v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Recommender Systems (RS) are fundamental to modern online services. While
most existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has
begun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value.
However, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic
action spaces inherent in recommendation, which hinder stable policy learning.
To resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which
reframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL
encodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to
their original items via a fixed, invertible lookup during execution. To align
decision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN)
operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state
modeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual,
thereby stabilizing training and reducing representation-decision mismatch. In
parallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates,
enabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a
large-scale production dataset from a leading Chinese short-video advertising
platform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online
deployment over a seven-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% CVR lift with
only a 1.251% increase in cost, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for
RL-based recommendation. Our code is released at

Generative Data Augmentation in Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation,"Yansong Wang, Qihui Lin, Junjie Huang, Tao Jia",2025-10-10,2510.09129v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09129v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09129v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Recommendation systems have become indispensable in various online platforms,
from e-commerce to streaming services. A fundamental challenge in this domain
is learning effective embeddings from sparse user-item interactions. While
contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to this
issue, generating augmented views for contrastive learning through most
existing random data augmentation methods often leads to the alteration of
original semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
GDA4Rec (Generative Data Augmentation in graph contrastive learning for
Recommendation) to generate high-quality augmented views and provide robust
self-supervised signals. Specifically, we employ a noise generation module that
leverages deep generative models to approximate the distribution of original
data for data augmentation. Additionally, GDA4Rec further extracts an item
complement matrix to characterize the latent correlations between items and
provide additional self-supervised signals. Lastly, a joint objective that
integrates recommendation, data augmentation and contrastive learning is used
to enforce the model to learn more effective and informative embeddings.
Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to demonstrate the
superiority of the model. The code is available at:

Personalize Before Retrieve: LLM-based Personalized Query Expansion for User-Centric Retrieval,"Yingyi Zhang, Pengyue Jia, Derong Xu, Yi Wen, Xianneng Li, Yichao Wang, Wenlin Zhang, Xiaopeng Li, Weinan Gan, Huifeng Guo, Yong Liu, Xiangyu Zhao",2025-10-10,2510.08935v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08935v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08935v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) critically depends on effective query
expansion to retrieve relevant information. However, existing expansion methods
adopt uniform strategies that overlook user-specific semantics, ignoring
individual expression styles, preferences, and historical context. In practice,
identical queries in text can express vastly different intentions across users.
This representational rigidity limits the ability of current RAG systems to
generalize effectively in personalized settings. Specifically, we identify two
core challenges for personalization: 1) user expression styles are inherently
diverse, making it difficult for standard expansions to preserve personalized
intent. 2) user corpora induce heterogeneous semantic structures-varying in
topical focus and lexical organization-which hinders the effective anchoring of
expanded queries within the user's corpora space. To address these challenges,
we propose Personalize Before Retrieve (PBR), a framework that incorporates
user-specific signals into query expansion prior to retrieval. PBR consists of
two components: P-PRF, which generates stylistically aligned pseudo feedback
using user history for simulating user expression style, and P-Anchor, which
performs graph-based structure alignment over user corpora to capture its
structure. Together, they produce personalized query representations tailored
for retrieval. Experiments on two personalized benchmarks show that PBR
consistently outperforms strong baselines, with up to 10% gains on PersonaBench
across retrievers. Our findings demonstrate the value of modeling
personalization before retrieval to close the semantic gap in user-adaptive RAG
systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zhang-Yingyi/PBR-code.",https://github.com/Zhang-Yingyi/PBR-code,

""needle-in-a-haystack"" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy

haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models

Are LLMs Reliable Rankers? Rank Manipulation via Two-Stage Token Optimization,"Tiancheng Xing, Jerry Li, Yixuan Du, Xiyang Hu",2025-10-08,2510.06732v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06732v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06732v1,information_retrieval,cs.CL,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as rerankers in

natural-sounding prompts. To expose this vulnerability, we present Rank
Anything First (RAF), a two-stage token optimization method that crafts concise
textual perturbations to consistently promote a target item in LLM-generated
rankings while remaining hard to detect. Stage 1 uses Greedy Coordinate
Gradient to shortlist candidate tokens at the current position by combining the
gradient of the rank-target with a readability score; Stage 2 evaluates those
candidates under exact ranking and readability losses using an entropy-based

sampling. RAF generates ranking-promoting prompts token-by-token, guided by
dual objectives: maximizing ranking effectiveness and preserving linguistic
naturalness. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that RAF significantly
boosts the rank of target items using naturalistic language, with greater
robustness than existing methods in both promoting target items and maintaining

when addressing cold-start scenarios involving new users or items. Multi-source

signals not as losses to be minimized, but as rewards that guide a generative

the LLM from an opaque encoder into an interpretable agent whose reasoning

improves overall score by 11.5% over base models, and the unsupervised variant

node representations, which is highly sensitive to popularity bias, resulting
in an echo effect during information propagation. Existing graph-based
debiasing solutions refine the aggregation process with attempts such as edge

in fully alleviating popularity bias. Specifically, this is because 1) they
provide no insights into graph aggregation rationality, thus lacking an
optimality guarantee; 2) they fail to well balance the training and debiasing
process, which undermines the effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to mitigate popularity bias through rational modeling of the graph
aggregation process. We reveal that graph aggregation is a special form of
backdoor adjustment in causal inference, where the aggregation weight
corresponds to the historical interaction likelihood distribution. Based on
this insight, we devise an encoder-decoder architecture, namely Causality-aware
Graph Aggregation Weight Estimator for Debiasing (CAGED), to approximate the
unbiased aggregation weight by optimizing the evidence lower bound of the
interaction likelihood. In order to enhance the debiasing effectiveness during
early training stages, we further design a momentum update strategy that

NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
