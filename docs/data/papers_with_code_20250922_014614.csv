Music4All A+A: A Multimodal Dataset for Music Information Retrieval Tasks,"Jonas Geiger, Marta Moscati, Shah Nawaz, Markus Schedl",2025-09-18,2509.14891v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14891v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14891v1,information_retrieval,cs.MM,"Music is characterized by aspects related to different modalities, such as
the audio signal, the lyrics, or the music video clips. This has motivated the
development of multimodal datasets and methods for Music Information Retrieval
(MIR) tasks such as genre classification or autotagging. Music can be described
at different levels of granularity, for instance defining genres at the level
of artists or music albums. However, most datasets for multimodal MIR neglect
this aspect and provide data at the level of individual music tracks. We aim to
fill this gap by providing Music4All Artist and Album (Music4All A+A), a
dataset for multimodal MIR tasks based on music artists and albums. Music4All
A+A is built on top of the Music4All-Onion dataset, an existing track-level
dataset for MIR tasks. Music4All A+A provides metadata, genre labels, image
representations, and textual descriptors for 6,741 artists and 19,511 albums.
Furthermore, since Music4All A+A is built on top of Music4All-Onion, it allows
access to other multimodal data at the track level, including user--item
interaction data. This renders Music4All A+A suitable for a broad range of MIR
tasks, including multimodal music recommendation, at several levels of
granularity. To showcase the use of Music4All A+A, we carry out experiments on
multimodal genre classification of artists and albums, including an analysis in
missing-modality scenarios, and a quantitative comparison with genre
classification in the movie domain. Our experiments show that images are more
informative for classifying the genres of artists and albums, and that several
multimodal models for genre classification struggle in generalizing across
domains. We provide the code to reproduce our experiments at

vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ
them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking
process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain
underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.
Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly
participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in
an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with
users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method
supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable
decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To
enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query
deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple
semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR),
composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our

the recommendations into a text-to-text generation task, harnessing the vast

this limitation, we propose a novel model, Generative Recommender Using Time

temporal signals. We first introduce Time-aware Prompting, consisting of two
key contexts. The user-level temporal context models personalized temporal
patterns across timestamps and time intervals, while the item-level transition
context provides transition patterns across users. We also devise Trend-aware
Inference, a training-free method that enhances rankings by incorporating trend
information about items with generation likelihood. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GRUT outperforms state-of-the-art models, with gains of up to
15.4% and 14.3% in Recall@5 and NDCG@5 across four benchmark datasets. The

Automated Generation of Research Workflows from Academic Papers: A Full-text Mining Framework,"Heng Zhang, Chengzhi Zhang",2025-09-16,2509.12955v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12955v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12955v1,information_retrieval,cs.CL,"The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of ""AI for Science"".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated

SPARK: Adaptive Low-Rank Knowledge Graph Modeling in Hybrid Geometric Spaces for Recommendation,"Binhao Wang, Yutian Xiao, Maolin Wang, Zhiqi Li, Tianshuo Wei, Ruocheng Guo, Xiangyu Zhao",2025-09-14,2509.11094v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11094v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11094v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enhance recommender systems but face challenges from
inherent noise, sparsity, and Euclidean geometry's inadequacy for complex
relational structures, critically impairing representation learning, especially
for long-tail entities. Existing methods also often lack adaptive multi-source
signal fusion tailored to item popularity. This paper introduces SPARK, a novel
multi-stage framework systematically tackling these issues. SPARK first employs
Tucker low-rank decomposition to denoise KGs and generate robust entity
representations. Subsequently, an SVD-initialized hybrid geometric GNN
concurrently learns representations in Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces; the
latter is strategically leveraged for its aptitude in modeling hierarchical
structures, effectively capturing semantic features of sparse, long-tail items.
A core contribution is an item popularity-aware adaptive fusion strategy that
dynamically weights signals from collaborative filtering, refined KG
embeddings, and diverse geometric spaces for precise modeling of both
mainstream and long-tail items. Finally, contrastive learning aligns these
multi-source representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPARK's
significant superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in
improving long-tail item recommendation, offering a robust, principled approach

technologies for e-commerce and content platforms, enabling personalized
services by jointly modeling users' historical behaviors and the multimodal

modeling, facing two critical limitations: (1) insufficient ability to model
fine-grained cross-modal associations, leading to suboptimal fusion quality;
and (2) a lack of global distribution-level consistency, causing
representational bias. To address these, we propose MambaRec, a novel framework
that integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization

Attention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with
channel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns
between visual and textual modalities. This module captures hierarchical
relationships and context-aware associations, improving cross-modal semantic
modeling. Additionally, we apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive
loss functions to constrain global modality alignment, enhancing semantic
consistency. This dual regularization reduces mode-specific deviations and
boosts robustness. To improve scalability, MambaRec employs a dimensionality
reduction strategy to lower the computational cost of high-dimensional

Multi-view-guided Passage Reranking with Large Language Models,"Jeongwoo Na, Jun Kwon, Eunseong Choi, Jongwuk Lee",2025-09-09,2509.07485v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07485v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07485v2,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive

(1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window
strategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the
number of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or
selection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and
increase input-order sensitivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a
novel passage reranking model, called Multi-View-guided Passage Reranking
(MVP). MVP is a non-generative LLM-based reranking method that encodes
query-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced
by external biases. For each view, it combines query-aware passage embeddings
to produce a distinct anchor vector, which is then used to directly compute
relevance scores in a single decoding step. In addition, it employs an
orthogonal loss to make the views more distinctive. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MVP, with just 220M parameters, matches the performance of
much larger 7B-scale fine-tuned models while achieving a 100x reduction in

quadratic cost of secure joins by leveraging the fact that, in practice, the
structure of many real queries allows us to join records and apply the
aggregations ""on the fly"" while keeping the result size bounded. On the system
side, ORQ contributes generic oblivious operators, a data-parallel vectorized

overhead. Tiga consolidates concurrency control and consensus, completing both
strictly serializable execution and consistent replication in a single round.
It uses synchronized clocks to proactively order transactions by assigning each
a future timestamp at submission. In most cases, transactions arrive at servers
before their future timestamps and are serialized according to the designated
timestamp, requiring 1 WRTT to commit. In rare cases, transactions are delayed
and proactive ordering fails, in which case Tiga falls back to a slow path,

automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,
methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured
ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like
NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of
semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To

decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree
operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate
pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:
forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward
validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from
