Benchmarking Computer Science Survey Generation,"Weihang Su, Anzhe Xie, Qingyao Ai, Jianming Long, Jiaxin Mao, Ziyi Ye, Yiqun Liu",2025-08-21,2508.15658v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15658v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15658v1,information_retrieval,cs.CL,"Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE",https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE,

business revenue in many online personalized services. However, current CTR
models generally encounter bottlenecks in performance improvement. Inspired by
the scaling law phenomenon of LLMs, we propose a new paradigm for improving CTR
predictions: first, constructing a CTR model with accuracy scalable to the
model grade and data size, and then distilling the knowledge implied in this
model into its lightweight model that can serve online users. To put it into
practice, we construct a CTR model named SUAN (Stacked Unified Attention
Network). In SUAN, we propose the UAB as a behavior sequence encoder. A single
UAB unifies the modeling of the sequential and non-sequential features and also
measures the importance of each user behavior feature from multiple
perspectives. Stacked UABs elevate the configuration to a high grade, paving
the way for performance improvement. In order to benefit from the high
performance of the high-grade SUAN and avoid the disadvantage of its long
inference time, we modify the SUAN with sparse self-attention and parallel
inference strategies to form LightSUAN, and then adopt online distillation to
train the low-grade LightSUAN, taking a high-grade SUAN as a teacher. The
distilled LightSUAN has superior performance but the same inference time as the
LightSUAN, making it well-suited for online deployment. Experimental results
show that SUAN performs exceptionally well and holds the scaling laws spanning
three orders of magnitude in model grade and data size, and the distilled
LightSUAN outperforms the SUAN configured with one grade higher. More
importantly, the distilled LightSUAN has been integrated into an online
service, increasing the CTR by 2.81% and CPM by 1.69% while keeping the average
inference time acceptable. Our source code is available at

Modeling Long-term User Behaviors with Diffusion-driven Multi-interest Network for CTR Prediction,"Weijiang Lai, Beihong Jin, Yapeng Zhang, Yiyuan Zheng, Rui Zhao, Jian Dong, Jun Lei, Xingxing Wang",2025-08-21,2508.15311v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15311v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15311v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction, crucial for recommender systems and
online advertising, etc., has been confirmed to benefit from modeling long-term
user behaviors. Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of
noise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness.
Recent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models.
However, current two-stage models often filter out significant information,
resulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the
complete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and
generative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest
Network) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user
interest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest
extraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain
interest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between
interest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user
interests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and
interest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented
interest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with
the latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted
interest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the
generated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive
offline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial
dataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN.
Moreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B

coherence across long, multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive

automatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval,
adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs
survey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and
then dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that
stores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across
subsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers
fine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I
leverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections.

simplistic user behavior, such as users preferring a rank list where items are
sorted by hand-crafted relevance. However, real-world user interactions are
influenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand
affinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail
to capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with
actual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across
the ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling
user behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank,
first trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item
permutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize
predicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling
end-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To
address the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen
permutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\textit{KD-Eval}$,
using a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii)
$\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language
models. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the

i.e., images and textual descriptions) of items to improve recommendation
performance. The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the
powerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these
methods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although
contrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to
address the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main
limitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective
representations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable
information in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the
homograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in
incomplete mining of user-item interplay.

existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods
fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to

preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.

user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task

accelerate training and inference, we investigated the recent generative
recommendation models HSTU and FuXi-$\alpha$, identifying two efficiency
bottlenecks: the indexing operations in relative temporal attention bias and
the computation of the query-key attention map. Additionally, we observed that
relative attention bias in self-attention mechanisms can also serve as
attention maps. Previous works like Synthesizer have shown that alternative
forms of attention maps can achieve similar performance, naturally raising the
question of whether some attention maps are redundant. Through empirical
experiments, we discovered that using the query-key attention map might degrade
the model's performance in recommendation tasks. To address these bottlenecks,
we propose a new framework applicable to Transformer-like recommendation
models. On one hand, we introduce Functional Relative Attention Bias, which
avoids the time-consuming operations of the original relative attention bias,
thereby accelerating the process. On the other hand, we remove the query-key
attention map from the original self-attention layer and design a new
Attention-Free Token Mixer module. Furthermore, by applying this framework to

multi-scale tiling to capture plants at different scales, dynamic threshold
optimization based on mean prediction length, and ensemble strategies through
bagging and Hydra model architectures. The approach incorporates various
inference techniques including image cropping to remove non-plant artifacts,
top-n filtering for prediction constraints, and logit thresholding strategies.

AmbiSQL: Interactive Ambiguity Detection and Resolution for Text-to-SQL,"Zhongjun Ding, Yin Lin, Tianjing Zeng",2025-08-21,2508.15276v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15276v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15276v1,databases,cs.DB,"Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

Cold-RL: Learning Cache Eviction with Offline Reinforcement Learning for NGINX,"Aayush Gupta, Arpit Bhayani",2025-08-17,2508.12485v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12485v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12485v1,databases,cs.LG,"Web proxies such as NGINX commonly rely on least-recently-used (LRU)
eviction, which is size agnostic and can thrash under periodic bursts and mixed
object sizes. We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that
replaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an
ONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL
samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features
(age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT),
and requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers
immediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying
NGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained
object earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against
LRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial
workloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538,
a 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from
0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods
(about 0.918). Inference adds less than 2 percent CPU overhead and keeps 95th
percentile eviction latency within budget. To our knowledge, this is the first
reinforcement learning eviction policy integrated into NGINX with strict SLOs.",https://github.com/ayushgupta4897/DRL-Cache,"8 pages, 4 figures (system architecture, eviction path, training

massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released

increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement. Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN",https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN,Preprint Version
DBAIOps: A Reasoning LLM-Enhanced Database Operation and Maintenance System using Knowledge Graphs,"Wei Zhou, Peng Sun, Xuanhe Zhou, Qianglei Zang, Ji Xu, Tieying Zhang, Guoliang Li, Fan Wu",2025-08-02,2508.01136v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01136v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01136v1,databases,cs.DB,"The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to
ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert
experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective
diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods,
including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On
the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,
metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and
cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting
guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve
fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate
inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present
DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with
knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a
heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and
proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from
thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)
reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and
implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps
proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis
paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a
reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear
diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four
mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates
that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher
in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.",https://github.com/weAIDB/DBAIOps,"DBAIOps supports 25 database systems and has been deployed in 20
