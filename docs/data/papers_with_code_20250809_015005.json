    "abstract": "In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommenders have shown\npromise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. A key\ncharacteristic of this domain is repetitive listening, where users frequently\nreplay familiar tracks. To capture these repetition patterns, recent research\nhas introduced Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS), which quantify\nuser-specific preferences based on historical frequency. While PPS enhances\nrelevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content,\nlimiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key\nelements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction. To address\nthis limitation, we build upon RecJPQ, a Transformer-based framework initially\ndeveloped to improve scalability in large-item catalogues through sub-item\ndecomposition. We repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model\npersonalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture\nshared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings - latent structures not\naccessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration\nof sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling\nexplicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty.\nOur sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by\nachieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising\nrecommendation accuracy.

Recently, generative recommendation\nhas emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional\nretrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic\ngeneration. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained\nby their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from\ntwo critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking\na coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement\n(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that\nlearns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core\ninnovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization\nprocess that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more\nuniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict\nhierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for\neach recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE\nincorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space\noverlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but\nalso promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive\nutilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled\nIDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models.

Although a few recent works try to\ntackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally\nand simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval.\nThese designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video\nmoment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or\nbackground sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end,\nwe propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which\nlearns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts\nfor VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and\naudio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance\npredictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly\nassigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we\ndesign a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and\nvisual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their\ncomplementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation\nstrategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference.\nTo evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e.,\nCharades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and\nre-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability\nin utilizing audio modality.

However, this task\nis severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and\nhigh inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete\nsegmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class\nrepresentations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging\nclass-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations\nand a neglect of target structural information.\n  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network\n(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete\nground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its\nvariant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key\nmodules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures\nsemantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract\nunbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure\nCoordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,\nstructure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic\ncognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the\nsemantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.\nFinally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic\nstep-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between\nclasses.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods.

However, the persistent hubness problem, a phenomenon where\na small number of targets frequently appear as nearest neighbors to numerous\nqueries, continues to hinder the precision of similarity measurements. Despite\nseveral proposed methods to reduce hubness, their underlying mechanisms remain\npoorly understood. To bridge this gap, we analyze the widely-adopted Inverted\nSoftmax approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing target\nprobabilities during retrieval. Building on these insights, we propose a\nprobability-balancing framework for more effective hubness reduction. We\ncontend that balancing target probabilities alone is inadequate and, therefore,\nextend the framework to balance both query and target probabilities by\nintroducing Sinkhorn Normalization (SN). Notably, we extend SN to scenarios\nwhere the true query distribution is unknown, showing that current methods,\nwhich rely solely on a query bank to estimate target hubness, produce\nsuboptimal results due to a significant distributional gap between the query\nbank and targets. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Dual Bank Sinkhorn\nNormalization (DBSN), incorporating a corresponding target bank alongside the\nquery bank to narrow this distributional gap. Our comprehensive evaluation\nacross various cross-modal retrieval tasks, including image-text retrieval,\nvideo-text retrieval, and audio-text retrieval, demonstrates consistent\nperformance improvements, validating the effectiveness of both SN and DBSN.

In recommender systems, prior work has established that\noptimizing the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss contributes to the\nobjectives of alignment and uniformity. Specifically, alignment aims to draw\ntogether the representations of interacting users and items, while uniformity\nmandates a uniform distribution of user and item embeddings across a unit\nhypersphere.

Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)\nreusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and\nimplicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps\nproposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis\npaths and identify missing relations automatically.

    "abstract": "In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has\nbecome pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination\nissues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing\nsingle-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address\ndifferent types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world\nqueries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost\nefficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an\nadaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent\norchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.\nSpecifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG\nmodules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and\ngeneration agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the\nappropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for\neach query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable\ncosts. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement\nlearning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based\npenalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a\nreasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate\nthat our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only\nachieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within\nacceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on\nhttps://github.com/chenyiqun/Agentic-RAG.",

    "abstract": "Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become\nincreasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this\npaper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS\noptimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves\nas the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of\nprogressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy\nconstraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness\nacross six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against\nstate-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance\non three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and\nGloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean\nand GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond\nANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning\ncan function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic\noptimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual\nrefinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN",

    "abstract": "The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to\nensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert\nexperience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective\ndiagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods,\nincluding commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On\nthe one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,\nmetric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and\ncannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting\nguidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve\nfragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate\ninaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present\nDBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with\nknowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a\nheterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and\nproposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from\nthousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)\nreusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and\nimplicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps\nproposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis\npaths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a\nreasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear\ndiagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four\nmainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates\nthat DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher\nin root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that\ncould augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.\nAlthough large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines\nfor converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack\nof benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific\ndomains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such\nbenchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and\nscalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an\nend-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for\nkey-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available\ntabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage\n``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding\nnatural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,\nwe introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)\nLLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)\nobjective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We\nevaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results\nreveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,\nthey struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,\nmodels presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this\ninformation becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction.

By employing an\nimproved cuckoo search algorithm (HN-CSA), the literature retrieval efficiency\nis significantly enhanced, achieving improvements of 7.1% and 3.4% compared to\nthe NSGA-II and CSA search algorithms, respectively. A hierarchical feature\nfusion framework is constructed, using Word2Vec encoding to encode\nsubsystem/component features, BERT-KPCA to process failure modes/reasons, and\nSentence-BERT to quantify the semantic association between failure impact and\nemergency decision-making. The dataset covers 12 systems, 1,262 failure modes,\nand 6,150 propagation paths. Validation results show that the GATE-GNN model\nachieves a classification accuracy of 0.735, comparable to existing benchmarks.\nAdditionally, a silhouette coefficient of 0.641 indicates that the features are\nhighly distinguishable. In the label prediction results, the Shore-based\nMeteorological Service System achieved an F1 score of 0.93, demonstrating high\nprediction accuracy.
