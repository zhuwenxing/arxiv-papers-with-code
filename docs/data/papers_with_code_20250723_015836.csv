Hierarchical Graph Information Bottleneck for Multi-Behavior Recommendation,"Hengyu Zhang, Chunxu Shen, Xiangguo Sun, Jie Tan, Yanchao Tan, Yu Rong, Hong Cheng, Lingling Yi",2025-07-21,2507.15395v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15395v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15395v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"In real-world recommendation scenarios, users typically engage with platforms
through multiple types of behavioral interactions. Multi-behavior
recommendation algorithms aim to leverage various auxiliary user behaviors to
enhance prediction for target behaviors of primary interest (e.g., buy),
thereby overcoming performance limitations caused by data sparsity in target
behavior records. Current state-of-the-art approaches typically employ
hierarchical design following either cascading (e.g.,
view$\rightarrow$cart$\rightarrow$buy) or parallel
(unified$\rightarrow$behavior$\rightarrow$specific components) paradigms, to
capture behavioral relationships. However, these methods still face two
critical challenges: (1) severe distribution disparities across behaviors, and
(2) negative transfer effects caused by noise in auxiliary behaviors. In this
paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic Hierarchical Graph Information
Bottleneck (HGIB) framework for multi-behavior recommendation to effectively
address these challenges. Following information bottleneck principles, our
framework optimizes the learning of compact yet sufficient representations that
preserve essential information for target behavior prediction while eliminating
task-irrelevant redundancies. To further mitigate interaction noise, we
introduce a Graph Refinement Encoder (GRE) that dynamically prunes redundant
edges through learnable edge dropout mechanisms. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on three real-world public datasets, which demonstrate the superior
effectiveness of our framework. Beyond these widely used datasets in the
academic community, we further expand our evaluation on several real industrial
scenarios and conduct an online A/B testing, showing again a significant
improvement in multi-behavior recommendations. The source code of our proposed

U-MARVEL: Unveiling Key Factors for Universal Multimodal Retrieval via Embedding Learning with MLLMs,"Xiaojie Li, Chu Li, Shi-Zhe Chen, Xi Chen",2025-07-20,2507.14902v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14902v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14902v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Universal multimodal retrieval (UMR), which aims to address complex retrieval
tasks where both queries and candidates span diverse modalities, has been
significantly advanced by the emergence of MLLMs. While state-of-the-art
MLLM-based methods in the literature predominantly adopt contrastive learning
principles, they often differ in their specific training recipes. Despite their
success, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely
unexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited
generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive
study aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding
learning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based
embedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary
contributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we
explore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training
strategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and
re-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked
factors can have a substantial impact on model performance. Building on these
discoveries, we introduce a unified framework termed U-MARVEL

Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Structured Enterprise and Internal Data,Chandana Cheerla,2025-07-16,2507.12425v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12425v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12425v1,information_retrieval,cs.CL,"Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR
records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative
capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,
and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but
often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval
strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by
metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The
framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains
tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing
optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and
conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5
increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),
and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative
evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness
(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.
These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,
comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future
work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based
retrieval. The source code will be released at

DyG-RAG: Dynamic Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Event-Centric Reasoning,"Qingyun Sun, Jiaqi Yuan, Shan He, Xiao Guan, Haonan Yuan, Xingcheng Fu, Jianxin Li, Philip S.

grounding large language models with external structured knowledge. However,
existing Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their
inability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In
this work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over
temporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal
ambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units
(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal
anchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture
temporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event
graph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting
efficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent
generation, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that
retrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time
Chain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This
unified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event
sequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG
systems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of
three typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more
faithful and temporal-aware generation. DyG-RAG is available at

Non-parametric Graph Convolution for Re-ranking in Recommendation Systems,"Zhongyu Ouyang, Mingxuan Ju, Soroush Vosoughi, Yanfang Ye",2025-07-14,2507.09969v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09969v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09969v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Graph knowledge has been proven effective in enhancing item rankings in
recommender systems (RecSys), particularly during the retrieval stage. However,
its application in the ranking stage, especially when richer contextual
information in user-item interactions is available, remains underexplored. A
major challenge lies in the substantial computational cost associated with
repeatedly retrieving neighborhood information from billions of items stored in
distributed systems. This resource-intensive requirement makes it difficult to
scale graph-based methods in practical RecSys. To bridge this gap, we first
demonstrate that incorporating graphs in the ranking stage improves ranking
qualities. Notably, while the improvement is evident, we show that the
substantial computational overheads entailed by graphs are prohibitively
expensive for real-world recommendations. In light of this, we propose a
non-parametric strategy that utilizes graph convolution for re-ranking only
during test time. Our strategy circumvents the notorious computational
overheads from graph convolution during training, and utilizes structural
knowledge hidden in graphs on-the-fly during testing. It can be used as a
plug-and-play module and easily employed to enhance the ranking ability of
various ranking layers of a real-world RecSys with significantly reduced
computational overhead. Through comprehensive experiments across four benchmark
datasets with varying levels of sparsity, we demonstrate that our strategy
yields noticeable improvements (i.e., 8.1% on average) during testing time with
little to no additional computational overheads (i.e., 0.5 on average). Code:

Generative Cognitive Diagnosis,"Jiatong Li, Qi Liu, Mengxiao Zhu",2025-07-13,2507.09831v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09831v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09831v1,information_retrieval,cs.LG,"Cognitive diagnosis (CD) models latent cognitive states of human learners by
analyzing their response patterns on diagnostic tests, serving as a crucial
machine learning technique for educational assessment and evaluation.
Traditional cognitive diagnosis models typically follow a transductive
prediction paradigm that optimizes parameters to fit response scores and
extract learner abilities. These approaches face significant limitations as
they cannot perform instant diagnosis for new learners without computationally
expensive retraining and produce diagnostic outputs with limited reliability.
In this study, we introduces a novel generative diagnosis paradigm that
fundamentally shifts CD from predictive to generative modeling, enabling
inductive inference of cognitive states without parameter re-optimization. We
propose two simple yet effective instantiations of this paradigm: Generative
Item Response Theory (G-IRT) and Generative Neural Cognitive Diagnosis Model
(G-NCDM), which achieve excellent performance improvements over traditional
methods. The generative approach disentangles cognitive state inference from
response prediction through a well-designed generation process that
incorporates identifiability and monotonicity conditions. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in
addressing scalability and reliability challenges, especially $\times 100$
speedup for the diagnosis of new learners. Our framework opens new avenues for
cognitive diagnosis applications in artificial intelligence, particularly for
intelligent model evaluation and intelligent education systems. The code is

Ambiguity-Aware and High-Order Relation Learning for Multi-Grained Image-Text Matching,"Junyu Chen, Yihua Gao, Mingyuan Ge, Mingyong Li",2025-07-12,2507.09256v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09256v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09256v1,information_retrieval,cs.CV,"Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer
vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face
challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among
similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft
positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft
negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching
uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the
neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training
batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.
This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning
framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified
representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,
effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework
introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive
aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic
understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and
inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships
among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic
interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum
contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined
strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between
features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,
considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The

for similar columns, where two columns are considered similar syntactically if
there is a set overlap or they are considered similar semantically if either
the column embeddings or value embeddings are closer in the embedding space.
However, for enterprise data lakes, column similarity is not sufficient to
identify joinable columns and tables. The context of the query column is
important. Hence, in this work, we first define context-aware column
joinability. Then we propose a multi-criteria approach, called TOPJoin, for
