PatenTEB: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Model Family for Patent Text Embedding,"Iliass Ayaou, Denis Cavallucci",2025-10-25,2510.22264v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22264v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22264v1,information_retrieval,cs.CL,"Patent text embeddings enable prior art search, technology landscaping, and
patent analysis, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture patent-specific
challenges. We introduce PatenTEB, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 15
tasks across retrieval, classification, paraphrase, and clustering, with 2.06
million examples. PatenTEB employs domain-stratified splits, domain specific
hard negative mining, and systematic coverage of asymmetric
fragment-to-document matching scenarios absent from general embedding
benchmarks. We develop the patembed model family through multi-task training,
spanning 67M to 344M parameters with context lengths up to 4096 tokens.
External validation shows strong generalization: patembed-base achieves
state-of-the-art on MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2 (0.494 V-measure vs. 0.445
previous best), while patembed-large achieves 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM.
Systematic ablations reveal that multi-task training improves external
generalization despite minor benchmark costs, and that domain-pretrained
initialization provides consistent advantages across task families. All

Hybrid-Vector Retrieval for Visually Rich Documents: Combining Single-Vector Efficiency and Multi-Vector Accuracy,"Juyeon Kim, Geon Lee, Dongwon Choi, Taeuk Kim, Kijung Shin",2025-10-25,2510.22215v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22215v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22215v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Retrieval over visually rich documents is essential for tasks such as legal
discovery, scientific search, and enterprise knowledge management. Existing
approaches fall into two paradigms: single-vector retrieval, which is efficient
but coarse, and multi-vector retrieval, which is accurate but computationally
expensive. To address this trade-off, we propose HEAVEN, a two-stage
hybrid-vector framework. In the first stage, HEAVEN efficiently retrieves
candidate pages using a single-vector method over Visually-Summarized Pages
(VS-Pages), which assemble representative visual layouts from multiple pages.
In the second stage, it reranks candidates with a multi-vector method while
filtering query tokens by linguistic importance to reduce redundant
computations. To evaluate retrieval systems under realistic conditions, we also
introduce ViMDOC, the first benchmark for visually rich, multi-document, and
long-document retrieval. Across four benchmarks, HEAVEN attains 99.87% of the
Recall@1 performance of multi-vector models on average while reducing per-query
computation by 99.82%, achieving efficiency and accuracy. Our code and datasets

A Benchmark for Open-Domain Numerical Fact-Checking Enhanced by Claim Decomposition,"V Venktesh, Deepali Prabhu, Avishek Anand",2025-10-24,2510.22055v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22055v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22055v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Fact-checking numerical claims is critical as the presence of numbers provide
mirage of veracity despite being fake potentially causing catastrophic impacts
on society. The prior works in automatic fact verification do not primarily
focus on natural numerical claims. A typical human fact-checker first retrieves
relevant evidence addressing the different numerical aspects of the claim and
then reasons about them to predict the veracity of the claim. Hence, the search
process of a human fact-checker is a crucial skill that forms the foundation of
the verification process. Emulating a real-world setting is essential to aid in
the development of automated methods that encompass such skills. However,
existing benchmarks employ heuristic claim decomposition approaches augmented
with weakly supervised web search to collect evidences for verifying claims.
This sometimes results in less relevant evidences and noisy sources with
temporal leakage rendering a less realistic retrieval setting for claim
verification. Hence, we introduce QuanTemp++: a dataset consisting of natural
numerical claims, an open domain corpus, with the corresponding relevant
evidence for each claim. The evidences are collected through a claim
decomposition process approximately emulating the approach of human
fact-checker and veracity labels ensuring there is no temporal leakage. Given
this dataset, we also characterize the retrieval performance of key claim
decomposition paradigms. Finally, we observe their effect on the outcome of the
verification pipeline and draw insights. The code for data pipeline along with

interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,

Pctx: Tokenizing Personalized Context for Generative Recommendation,"Qiyong Zhong, Jiajie Su, Yunshan Ma, Julian McAuley, Yupeng Hou",2025-10-24,2510.21276v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21276v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21276v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Generative recommendation (GR) models tokenize each action into a few
discrete tokens (called semantic IDs) and autoregressively generate the next
tokens as predictions, showing advantages such as memory efficiency,
scalability, and the potential to unify retrieval and ranking. Despite these
benefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They
typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal
item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the
autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive
similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a
universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item
may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To
address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that
incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs.
This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs
under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple
interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions. Experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 over
non-personalized action tokenization baselines. Our code is available at

enabling users to express preferences and receive recommendations through

challenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate
required output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the
end of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage
framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender
systems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a
Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded
demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In
Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats
each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too
fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal
credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the
geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates.
Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges
faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines. Code and

item via a tokenizer as an n-digit semantic ID (SID) and predicts the next item
by autoregressively generating its SID conditioned on the user's history.
However, two structural properties of SIDs make ARMs ill-suited. First,
intra-item consistency: the n digits jointly specify one item, yet the
left-to-right causality trains each digit only under its prefix and blocks
bidirectional cross-digit evidence, collapsing supervision to a single causal
path. Second, inter-digit heterogeneity: digits differ in semantic granularity
and predictability, while the uniform next-token objective assigns equal weight
to all digits, overtraining easy digits and undertraining hard digits. To
address these two issues, we propose DiffGRM, a diffusion-based GR model that
replaces the autoregressive decoder with a masked discrete diffusion model
(MDM), thereby enabling bidirectional context and any-order parallel generation
of SID digits for recommendation. Specifically, we tailor DiffGRM in three
aspects: (1) tokenization with Parallel Semantic Encoding (PSE) to decouple
digits and balance per-digit information; (2) training with On-policy Coherent
Noising (OCN) that prioritizes uncertain digits via coherent masking to
concentrate supervision on high-value signals; and (3) inference with
Confidence-guided Parallel Denoising (CPD) that fills higher-confidence digits
first and generates diverse Top-K candidates. Experiments show consistent gains
over strong generative and discriminative recommendation baselines on multiple

FACE: A General Framework for Mapping Collaborative Filtering Embeddings into LLM Tokens,"Chao Wang, Yixin Song, Jinhui Ye, Chuan Qin, Dazhong Shen, Lingfeng Liu, Xiang Wang, Yanyong Zhang",2025-10-17,2510.15729v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15729v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15729v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored for integration
with collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommendation systems, which are
crucial for personalizing user experiences. However, a key challenge is that
LLMs struggle to interpret the latent, non-semantic embeddings produced by CF
approaches, limiting recommendation effectiveness and further applications. To
address this, we propose FACE, a general interpretable framework that maps CF
embeddings into pre-trained LLM tokens. Specifically, we introduce a
disentangled projection module to decompose CF embeddings into concept-specific
vectors, followed by a quantized autoencoder to convert continuous embeddings
into LLM tokens (descriptors). Then, we design a contrastive alignment
objective to ensure that the tokens align with corresponding textual signals.
Hence, the model-agnostic FACE framework achieves semantic alignment without
fine-tuning LLMs and enhances recommendation performance by leveraging their
pre-trained capabilities. Empirical results on three real-world recommendation
datasets demonstrate performance improvements in benchmark models, with
interpretability studies confirming the interpretability of the descriptors.

Retrieval (IR). A key challenge with these neural Transformer-based models is
that they often struggle to generalize beyond the specific tasks and domains
they were trained on. To address this challenge, prior research in IR
incorporated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within each Transformer
layer of a DRM, which, though effective, substantially increased the number of
additional parameters. In this paper, we propose a more efficient design, which
introduces a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the final Transformer layer. To
assess the retrieval effectiveness of SB-MoE, we perform an empirical
evaluation across three IR tasks. Our experiments involve two evaluation
setups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot
generalizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different
underlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective
test sets. In the second setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE on MSMARCO and perform
zero-shot evaluation on thirteen BEIR datasets. Additionally, we perform
further experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters
(i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this
variation affects SB-MoE's performance. The obtained results show that SB-MoE
is particularly effective for DRMs with lightweight base models, such as

in utility-based SPM focuses on high-utility sequential patterns, and the
definitions and strategies used in high-utility SPM cannot be directly applied
to LUSPM. Moreover, no algorithms have yet been developed specifically for

EMR-AGENT: Automating Cohort and Feature Extraction from EMR Databases,"Kwanhyung Lee, Sungsoo Hong, Joonhyung Park, Jeonghyeop Lim, Juhwan Choi, Donghwee Yoon, Eunho Yang",2025-10-01,2510.00549v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00549v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00549v2,databases,cs.DB,"Machine learning models for clinical prediction rely on structured data
extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), yet this process remains
dominated by hardcoded, database-specific pipelines for cohort definition,
feature selection, and code mapping. These manual efforts limit scalability,
reproducibility, and cross-institutional generalization. To address this, we
introduce EMR-AGENT (Automated Generalized Extraction and Navigation Tool), an
agent-based framework that replaces manual rule writing with dynamic, language
model-driven interaction to extract and standardize structured clinical data.
Our framework automates cohort selection, feature extraction, and code mapping
through interactive querying of databases. Our modular agents iteratively
observe query results and reason over schema and documentation, using SQL not
just for data retrieval but also as a tool for database observation and
decision making. This eliminates the need for hand-crafted, schema-specific
logic. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop a benchmarking codebase for
three EMR databases (MIMIC-III, eICU, SICdb), including both seen and unseen
schema settings. Our results demonstrate strong performance and generalization
across these databases, highlighting the feasibility of automating a process
previously thought to require expert-driven design. The code will be released
publicly at https://github.com/AITRICS/EMR-AGENT/tree/main. For a

Graph2Region: Efficient Graph Similarity Learning with Structure and Scale Restoration,"Zhouyang Liu, Yixin Chen, Ning Liu, Jiezhong He, Dongsheng Li",2025-10-01,2510.00394v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00394v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00394v1,databases,cs.LG,"Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.",https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region,Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering
