Rejuvenating Cross-Entropy Loss in Knowledge Distillation for Recommender Systems,"Zhangchi Zhu, Wei Zhang",2025-09-25,2509.20989v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20989v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20989v1,information_retrieval,cs.IR,"This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD)

rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be
computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the
connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when
performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound
of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the
item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our

demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the

user-item interactions to help users discover new items in a vast collection.
In cold start, i.e., when interaction histories of users or items are not

Hybrid recommender systems (HRSs) often employ multimodal learning to combine
collaborative and side information, which we jointly refer to as modalities.
Though HRSs can provide recommendations when some modalities are missing, their
quality degrades. In this work, we utilize single-branch neural networks
equipped with weight sharing, modality sampling, and contrastive loss to
provide accurate recommendations even in missing modality scenarios by
narrowing the modality gap. We compare these networks with multi-branch

analyze how this ranking blind spot affects LLM evaluation systems through two
approaches: Decision Objective Hijacking, which alters the evaluation goal in
pairwise ranking systems, and Decision Criteria Hijacking, which modifies
relevance standards across ranking schemes. These approaches demonstrate how
content providers could potentially influence LLM-based ranking systems to
affect document positioning. These attacks aim to force the LLM ranker to
prefer a specific passage and rank it at the top. Malicious content providers
can exploit this weakness, which helps them gain additional exposure by
attacking the ranker. In our experiment, We empirically show that the proposed
attacks are effective in various LLMs and can be generalized to multiple
ranking schemes. We apply these attack to realistic examples to show their
effectiveness. We also found stronger LLMs are more vulnerable to these

Tiga: Accelerating Geo-Distributed Transactions with Synchronized Clocks [Technical Report],"Jinkun Geng, Shuai Mu, Anirudh Sivaraman, Balaji Prabhakar",2025-09-06,2509.05759v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05759v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05759v1,databases,cs.NI,"This paper presents Tiga, a new design for geo-replicated and scalable
transactional databases such as Google Spanner. Tiga aims to commit
transactions within 1 wide-area roundtrip time, or 1 WRTT, for a wide range of
scenarios, while maintaining high throughput with minimal computational
overhead. Tiga consolidates concurrency control and consensus, completing both
strictly serializable execution and consistent replication in a single round.
It uses synchronized clocks to proactively order transactions by assigning each
a future timestamp at submission. In most cases, transactions arrive at servers
before their future timestamps and are serialized according to the designated
timestamp, requiring 1 WRTT to commit. In rare cases, transactions are delayed
and proactive ordering fails, in which case Tiga falls back to a slow path,
committing in 1.5--2 WRTTs. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, Tiga can
commit more transactions at 1-WRTT latency, and incurs much less throughput
overhead. Evaluation results show that Tiga outperforms all baselines,
achieving 1.3--7.2$\times$ higher throughput and 1.4--4.6$\times$ lower
latency. Tiga is open-sourced at

Schema Inference for Tabular Data Repositories Using Large Language Models,"Zhenyu Wu, Jiaoyan Chen, Norman W. Paton",2025-09-04,2509.04632v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04632v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04632v1,databases,cs.DB,"Minimally curated tabular data often contain representational inconsistencies
across heterogeneous sources, and are accompanied by sparse metadata. Working
with such data is intimidating. While prior work has advanced dataset discovery
and exploration, schema inference remains difficult when metadata are limited.
We present SI-LLM (Schema Inference using Large Language Models), which infers
a concise conceptual schema for tabular data using only column headers and cell
values. The inferred schema comprises hierarchical entity types, attributes,
and inter-type relationships. In extensive evaluation on two datasets from web
tables and open data, SI-LLM achieves promising end-to-end results, as well as
better or comparable results to state-of-the-art methods at each step. All
source code, full prompts, and datasets of SI-LLM are available at
